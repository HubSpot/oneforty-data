For some cosmic/hormonal reason, I hated the Pixelpipe live demo I saw last week at SF New Tech. After TechCrunch’s review, I spewed some bile into the comments section about how there are already too many value-free aggregating/status pushing services and went on with my life. I now must nibble lightly on my words; Pixelpipe doesn’t suck.

The suprisingly simple three-click process for adding most “pipes” is among the fastest processes I’ve seen yet. Unfortunately, it’s giving me unidentifiable technical problems with pushing status updates to Facebook (mystery error message FTW?), and double-posting to TwitPic/Twitter (see the all-important redundancy note at the beginning of this gargantuan post). And I still can’t get the background image upload form to work.

Customization: Allows for custom or colored background/headline on a hosted page; but so far, I haven’t been able to make that work.

Content Posting: Uploads status updates/microblogs, photos, videos, audio, and other files; then pushes the content to any relevant social sites you’ve linked.

Mobile Functionality: Email, MMS, an iPhone app, an Android app, etc. Seems poised for mobile greatness.

Roasted: Medium rare. Stick a fork in it and send feedback to @brettb."

Today, we've been playing with TwitVid.com and the new, free TwitVid iPhone app. Both have greatly impressed us with a simple, well-integrated interface and just the right balance of great function without feature bloat. Does TwitVid have what it takes to win the Twitter-come-video game?

First, the user finds the song. As aforementioned, the song could be on a website, on a user's hard drive, or in the SongTwit library, which seems to consist of third party-hosted audio clips (this seems fine for web-based sharing, but we wonder how well it will work for various mobile devices). If the user is working from the SongTwit library, he is presented with a range of selections and is able to preview the song/video before it goes out as a tweet. There are a few flaws of the service, aside from the DM-less-ness. No downloads from these pages are yet available, and they're still working on the broken pause button on the media players. Still, the search function really does help save time that would likely have been spent trolling YouTube for clips of that one Venga Boys song from 1999. And that's what the Internet is for, no?"

Summary: It's still one of the most professional apps on S60 in the last few years. I'd argue it's better than most of the desktop Twitter clients as well, and easily an equal of Tweetdeck (the most popular third party Twitter client, after using the native web site). I've no hesitation in awarding it a score of 90 and an AAS Mega-app award, and urge anyone on Twitter to take a look."

"277"	"580"	"Veetrag"	"kv"	"5"	"0"	"2009-09-24 00:59:17 UTC"	"Tweetdeck is the best Twitter client. Since twitter stopped IM service, i couldn't find a better way to use twitter till i found Tweetdeck, over last 6 months i have used it extensively. I think its perfect, but with every new version its gets better and I like it more than before. 

Grouping feature has made my life much easier, now I can sort important tweets from some random rambling. I am not scared to follow more people now. 

Integration with Twitpic, Bit.ly (and other URL shortening services), 12 seconds, FB, MySpace etc keeps on making it more interesting. And specially after the launch of iPhone app and group syncing, its become the best client ever. "
"278"	"191"	"Jared Rea"	"jaredr"	"4"	"0"	"2009-09-24 00:59:18 UTC"	"I use HootSuite in my work-life and it's a very impressive client, though a bit slow across the board. The ability to schedule tweets and statistics for the built-in URL shortening are invaluable, and the relative ease of use will make involving more people than just myself on the Twittering process a snap. 

Switching between content panes, however, IS a pain. HootSuite can chug at times and its URL shortener comes with a content bar that can add a lot of load times for your readers during peek hours. Still, it's hard to argue with what they give you, especially considering its free at the moment."

One time I provided feedback, asking for more ""institutional"" rather than personal recommendations, and they dm'ed me with exactly what I was looking for.  The way they recommend seems somewhat simple--recommend people that a number of your followers follow and retweet--and so I think the service could do more to offer a more semantic way of knowing what you might like or look for.  A great recommendation service (beyond good, what Mr. Tweet is) would be able to direct me to new people/blogs/organizations that I'd otherwise miss even if I dug through my favorite twitterer's follows."

It's not as full featured as many other twitter apps like Tweetdeck or Tweetie, but that's not what they are trying to do. They just want to be a location aware service and they do it perfectly. "

If you follow hundreds of people, this is not going to be useful because of the lack of groups. I stopped using this solely for that reason. There is also no URL shortener which is almost a must now days. Power users need to try Tweetdeck or Seesmic Desktop, but not Tweetie for mac. With that being said...

This is BY FAR the best UI of any desktop twitter client I have used either on the Mac or the PC. It's clean, smooth, and actually a joy to use. If you're not a power user and just want a steady stream of tweets coming your way the the ability to reply, retweet, and send DM, maybe attached a pic or two, then this is YOUR twitter client.

It has support to change the quality of the pic/video you're uploading so you can attain faster uploading speeds on slower networks or vice versa.

Favstar is an untapped glory hole of mirth and joy.  Sure, you can go anywhere to find a few hundred RTd ""jokes,"" but if you want to find the real comedians of the interwebs, spend a few hours (or weeks) combing through Favstar.  You'll end up dumping all those celebrities you came to Twitter for in the first place, and replacing them with people not too different from yourself.

And you'll be inspired.  They will make you laugh, and you will respond.  You'll discover people who appreciate your words.  You will love them and spend hours trying to please them.  Your entire waking life will revolve around poop jokes and clever ways to improve on the meme of the day.  Pantslessness and bacon will always be on your mind.

Not that Favstar is an addiction, or anything.  I can quit anytime I want.

But to people who already are addicted to Twitter, Favstar is like your designated driver, enabling your self-destructive idiocy by rewarding absurdity.

Clips can include almost anything you find on a web page -- formatted text, images, even embedded video. Amplify also saves your clips to Delicious and Clipmarks, and they have recently added more social features which make it easy to follow clips and recommendations from your contacts.

It seems best at identifying spammers following non-commercial accounts. Running it on my personal account, many of its top-ranking suggestions were definitely spammers.

I really like the app, though it does take some getting used to. The interface can seem complex with contexts, active lists, etc... but it doesn't take too long before these make sense and become difficult to live without. I love that the app keeps my groups, lists, contexts synced between multiple computers/devices.  That means when I add people to new lists, create groups, etc on my home computer, when I sign in at work... all of these changes are synced. Love that. The app is still in development, but the devs are very responsive to feedback and are continuing to grow and refine the features.  The alpha iPhone app (not yet publicly available) is also very cool, with many of the same features of the desktop client.  The mobile version does have some drawbacks (loading time) but it's still early and the team is actively working to address user's wants and needs for the app.  Overall, definitely worth checking out Mixero."

The tabs, grouping functions a la Tweetdeck and threaded DMs make it a joy to use. In fact, I hardly ever tweet from my laptop anymore since I'm always on my BlackBerry anyway. Being able to view fullscreen pictures within tweets (any tweet containing a Twitpic link, for example) is an excellent feature, and the same can be done with their Facebook integration as well, complete with flick scrolling.

There are some bugs to be worked through, occasional display issues and such, and it doesn't have trending topic support like some of the other clients (UberTwitter, TwiXtreme) do. That's hardly a deterrent, though. Bottom line is, if you can get an invite to this, definitely do it. You won't be disappointed."

Be that as it may, I've seen an early alpha of Tweeteev (on a BlackBerry, anyway) in action and it seems fairly decent, although a bit laggy as well. It does have multiple account support, though, which is a nice plus. SocialScope will have that also when they get around to pushing out their next update. Tweeteev is fairly straightforward in its presentation of yours and friends' timelines, DMs and mentions. It also supports finding tweets from people local to you, so it presumably has GPS support (though doesn't insert your location like UberTwitter loves to).

From this early release? It's got some potential, but needs more time in the oven."

I don't have the hassle of logging in, I can look at replies and favorites without an internet connection, I can switch between accounts in a second and look at all of them without switching accounts, I don't have to wait for pages to load, and using the Facebook app ""Selective Status"", I can update Facebook from within Twhirl via Twitter.

Packed with features, it's simply unbeatable at the moment.

My favourite feature is the seamless landscape keyboard. With Tweetie, you have to change your settings to apply a landscape keyboard -- and then you ALWAYS have to use it! With Twittelator, you can change it on the fly, just by changing the orientation of your iDevice. Perfect.

It's a bit sad that, in such a feature-packed application, that's my absolute, number 1 favourite feature, but I love the landscape keyboard. But then, sometimes I just want to use one hand, so if I don't want to, I don't HAVE to use landscape. It's great.

My one complaint is the GUI.
Now, while it's not ugly by any means, it definitely needs a facelift. I contemplate going back to Tweetie sometimes just for the UI... I love brilliant design, and Tweetie wins in that category.
But, I always end up going back to Twittelator for all the great features. Definitely an awesome client."

I can use one search request to look for emails across accounts. I can post status updates to my Twitter accounts and Facebook. Setup and daily usage is quick and easy. 

HOWEVER, I do have some issues with it. I'm not thrilled with having to type my login info each day because it can't remember my login (web app). Unlike TweetDeck (which I use at the same time), it is not very clear which Twitter account(s) will receive my tweet. I have to click a dropdown to see. In a rush, I have sent to the wrong account. I have had issues with other services when I tried to authenticate and they didn't know which account I was intending because I was logged into them all. Also, the email inbox shows no indication of which account each message came from. A simple notation would be nice.

In short, the power of being logged in with multiple identities also means that there is a responsibility for Threadsy to make it clear what identity I am using to communicate with at each action. TweetDeck handles this with check boxes that are always evident.

I have high hopes for a client that can aggregate all of my communication IDs while honoring the separation that warrants multiple IDs in the first place. 

For now, I will use a few apps concurrently.

PS - add LinkedIn and Plaxo status to my ""unbound"" list."

Pro features I'm smitten over:

Push notifications, multiple client timeline sync (timeline picks up where you left off when Tweeting from different locations, i.e. phone and desktop).

However, I switched to UberTwitter when I heard about it and loved the many features. Particularly the ability to do @replies and DM, find trending subjects, photo sharing. It offers geo-tracking, but I find that rather spooky and have not used it."

I do think some interesting people have found me through Mr. Twitter, but have to agree with above comment that the sending out of messages about who you follow through Mr. Twitter is spammy."

The UI is delightful, the touch and slide element is so smooth, it is akin to using an iPhone.
I have rarely, if ever, had any functioning issues with PockeTwit.
All my friends are saved in one user group which auto-updates, my favourite searches are saved in other groups (which I choose not to have auto-updating).

it's really easy to link blip.fm to your twitter account and it shortens the links for you and adds a musical note so you don't have to do any extra work. good for new users, but you might want to hold off on how many songs you blip. and how consecutively you blip.

By design, it doesn't track everybody and it doesn't count everybody's faves either. It excludes webcocks like Michael Arrington (seriously, try viewing his user page on Favrd and savour the white-space), and it discriminates against the likes The Jonas Brothers, making it a better discovery tool for quality tweets; no chaff."

It's full of detailed views for both recent and overall popularity views of your posts, as well as identifying your biggest fans. It's a well presented wealth of data. Favstar seems to do an excellent job of crawling for faves, and collects the faves from all users as best it can. Favstar is a tool that's really great for personal stats gathering.

You can also view the popular tweets from across Twitter as a whole. The flipside of Favstar's indiscriminate crawling is that the stats for Twitter as a whole are less eclectic than on Favrd. On Favstar, you will have to scroll past the inanity posted by the Jonas Brothers, for example. (They appear to be a sufficiently unstoppable entity from the weight of their fanbase.) Favrd, on the other hand, has filtered out almost everyone that faves the Jonas Brothers, so you never see them. Favstar's views are more truthful and complete, and for the most part still a perfectly good way of discovering new content. There's just a hint of the Trending Topics/Retweet problem, where the outright wisdom of the crowd is not always the best way.

Fantastic, useful tool, constantly and passionately maintained by Tim. Great job."

The heritage to the original Mac OSX version remains, but the interface has evolved beautiful over the years into something that's refined and brilliant. Twitterrific is unique in that it merged tweets, @mentions and messages into a single stream, rather than distinct sections. This is by far the best way to read Twitter. You just scroll and it's all there. Rather than segregate types of content, you can instead filter the stream to show ‘just @mentions’ or ‘just DMs’, so you can get the same views as other apps, it's just implemented much, much better.

It has everything you could want and more: Multiple accounts, saved searches, an address book feature to look up Twitter users by name, photo and video upload, fantastic conversation views and functions to to find the follow-ups to people's questions.

As an iPhone purist, I highly recommend choosing the ‘Basic’ theme, as that has the app looking native on the iPhone, but all the themes are well built."

Twitterrific is one of the earliest desktop Twitter clients. It pioneered the integrated stream view (friends + @mentions + dms all in one list, rather than separated), and it's that feature that keeps me using it still.

There are other, far richer featured Twitter applications than Twitter for OSX. There are apps with slicker replies integration, messaging and integrated search, retweeting, photos and all sorts. This Twitter client is crude (you'll be typing ‘d @friend’ by hand for DMs), but it's fast, it's clean, stable and has excellent keyboard shortcuts.

I would dearly love to see a full update to bring Twitterrific kicking and screaming back into action and on par with its iPhone sibling; it's getting a little antiquated. But despite that, the combined stream view is the killer feature and I can't see myself moving away without that."

I do not use the advertising portion of Adjix (which I would consider intrusive).  Rather, I use it merely for convenience and analytics.

At the time I started using it, Adjix was one of the few applications that tracked how many clicks you got on a shortened URL.  Also, Adjix allows you to schedule tweets in advance, something I find convenient if I happen upon something on the Web, but have just tweeted 2 minutes ago -- I don't want to overwhelm followers with too frequent tweets.  And it has two bookmarklets that live on my Firefox browser, which make tweeting a page while browsing the Web tres convenient.

However, I feel that other apps are coming out that do many of these same things, and Adjix is falling behind in its product development.  I have not seen any major improvements.  And it is still annoying that you get logged out after 15 minutes. that makes it multiple clicks to get in and see scheduled tweets, stats on how many click-throughs you got, etc.  While I still use it, I'd like to see product improvements soon."

It's nice to see a developer actually optimising their application almost to the point of obsession rather than simply relying on the publics needs to constantly upgrade their hardware with more memory and CPU cores than really required just to run a simple application.

DestroyTwitter has all the features you could want in a desktop application and is presented in such a way that any other client's behaviour just seems odd to me now.

I downloaded a demo of Gravity and after minutes of using it I went to buy it. It is very, very cheap for what it is and I would, and do, recommend it to everyone with a Symbian based phone.

The features include everything you could want; timeline, replies, DMs, trending topics, custom searches, followers, following, twitpic, identica, and more recently facebook and GPS integration.

It is a self-updating app, and you can install the latest betas right from within the app itself. The GUI is intuitive, uncluttered and incredibly slick and pretty. One screen for each feature, and you're just scrolling right or left to view them. I love how I can roam without a connection then come back and I will be at the same Tweet as I left it with so I can catch up.

There's plenty more I could say about this app, but I urge you all to go and have the pleasure of experiencing it for yourself. If they did a desktop version of this app it would blow Tweetdeck away.

Oh one final thing -- before purchasing I also contacted customer support. They were quick to reply, very friendly and courteous and answered anything I had to ask quickly and sufficiently. A definite 5-star piece of software, without a bad review. For me, it's the killer app."

The fact that you can upload your own music plays a paramount role in allowing users to share what they are listening to, despite the fact that it may be extremely rare -- or, better yet, never heard before.

In addition, it enables several hashtags to be tracked simultaneously by defining aliases for a primary hashtag.

It's a great app for those interested in what is going on around you, but I found it irritating that they made it difficult to turn off the location-based tweets. I live in a college town, and I don't care what frat is throwing a kegger or who stole your underwear from the laundromat. You can't even get rid of the location-based tweets tab/navigation button.

The most annoying part was that it didn't save my options and account info. I had to go back in and change it regularly. 

Obviously this was not the app for me. But my rating moreso reflects the bugs I found within the app itself."

I did make one suggestion: to a include a filter for who has not mentioned you. If you're seeking to reduce the number of your followers, knowing who's accounts are relatively inactive (not having tweeted recently) and has neither mentioned you nor has been mentioned by you would simplify the task of who to unfollow.

It is occasionally a little buggy -- in that the number followers indicated does not match the number of thumbnails displayed even after clicking the ""Update"" button. This may be an issue with cache and needs to be tested across different browsers."

Viigo's RSS reader features are unsurpassed and the Twitter integration allows easy sharing of articles.  I find Viigo's full Twitter module to be slow, a major memory hog and less useful than UberTwitter so I limit my use of Twitter in Viigo to just sharing and in that the application excels.  Use Viigo for reading your RSS feeds and sharing with your friends via Twitter and leave socializing to other applications.  For that limited, but highly useful purpose I give Viigo 5 stars and would give more if they had them."

It's a better way to tweet.  Instead of making four or five tweets on one subject, you can blog them together and make one Tweet.  It's an excellent web-community of fellow bloggers on Amplify.  The main page streams the blogs of people you've been following. It has an interesting mechanism to Recommend what you like.  Better than RT (retweet).  It has smart search engine of its own.

Enhancements: 
1) I would love to see an easier way to add those you follow into different columns. (Some people don't tweet as often and as a result, I might miss adding them to a column from the home column.) 
2) It would be great to post to multiple handles at the same time.
3) It would be great to post status notes to Facebook from Seesmic, not just comment on other posts.
4) It would be great to be able to sync up columns between computers. Right now I have all the people I follow set up in columns on my work computer, but it its hard to keep up with it on my personal computer.

Other than that, I think its a fantastic tool! I'm looking forward to the iPhone app!"

This tool and service has helped me keep my list trim, neat and relevant and in turn, maintained a manageable stream. What's cool is that Foller.me's developer is constantly innovating, improving and adding new features to the service - open to suggestions, advice, and ideas and has so far proved to be efficient at delivering. Foller.me offers no clunky, chunky, snail-slow, loaded-to-the-brim user interface either; it has maintained simplicity and speed from the very beginning to effectively give users the data they need to decide whether or not - or at times, even how - they want to interact with other users. Foller.me can really help you decide whether you want to ""foller"" me."

Also there is no way to distinguish tweets from anything else, like an IM or BBM message for instance.

Twii allows you to post to one account at a time but allows easy switching between multiple accounts. The app supports landscape as well as portrait mode. Also, Twii has two themes: dark and light. These two themes switch the background between black and white.

The most beautiful feature of the Twii is the fact that it starts almost instantly. When I have an idea or thought to tweet, I don't want to be waiting 5 minutes for tweets to load. I need to post now and fast. Twii lets me do that.

I HIGHLY recommend Twii as your posting app for the iPhone!"

The only downside I found to hootsuite is the poor follower/folowee management features, it is rather tedious to add new followers that didn't tweet (lets say I wanted to add @ice_mouton to one of my profiles I need to search for a tweet BY @ice_mouton then I can follow him, before we could click on the username in a mention and the hootsuite popup would allow following, but now it redirects to twitter which is always logged into this account.)

For browser-based tweeting, Hootsuite is VERY customizable, and I ENJOY that and being able to follow ANY tweets streams I choose. Best of all, for heavy users, it provides the ability to access several Twitter accounts at once, to see and send tweets from them. If you want to follow certain hash (#...) marks, keywords, or specific users, you can set it up to follow anything from a core location.  I have a column of selected news feeds only, for example. It lets you do easy retweets, simple follows of others, and other cool features. I am so hooked I struggle on the regular Twitter site now!

I know, from using it, that Hootsuite works fine in Safari and Firefox. Twitter gets bogged down, so it gets bogged down, at times. If your browser is being stubborn, reload you page, that's usually the fix.

With far less effort than you might guess, until you try, Hootsuite turns Twitter blogging into a gaggle of streams. I strongly suggest Hootsuite!"

Twitter is an interesting beast with a myriad of tools and 3rd party applications. They all have their uses and particular niches, however there is only one that encompasses everything you really need. It's CoTweet. It is my sole application to engage with new followers, maintain relationships and to deploy my ever so precious content into the stream.

I was very fortunate to be involved with CoTweet in the development stages. I abused it to it's height and back down again. If any of you follow me, you'll know how prolific I am and if I get to tailor it to my preferences... it's GOLD! (and I'm not getting paid for this, although if CoTweet is listening... I have preference to German vehicles ;))

It's rare when someone like myself gets the opportunity to shape an application to suit my needs. Not one has been able to satisfy my thirst until now. If I only had one to pick from... it would be CoTweet.

I use this app all the time. It functions how you wish Twitter did, and now I get frustrated with the limitations Twitter has vs Echofon. e.g. Simple RTs. Auto-loads new tweets even while its running without losing where you are on the screen. Take pic from iPhone and make it part of your tweet. Post your location. Browse to links without leaving to open Safari. Favorites are easy to mark and review. etc. etc. etc. 

(Would get a fifth star if I could filter tweets by username from the main menu. Kind of like the search option but auto-fill username as I type. Then I can quickly click their name to see their thread. Sometimes I just want to see what one specific user has been saying without having to scroll and hunt for their name. @Echofon - add a quick filter by user button to main screen. Thx and keep up the good work!)"

But still it does a very good job...it handles the tweets a bit different as Digsby puts them in a chronological order. You can create groups, save searches, see the Twitter trends and instantly reply, retweet, favorite every tweet in just one click. Because of the chronological order it is easier to follow conversations between the people you follow and if you still missed out on something you can easily click the ""in reply too..."" link to see to which tweet one is replying too. I use Digsby as my one and only Twitter-application on pc (besides web) and I'm very satisfied with it.

It's also customizable, just like everything else in Digsby's broad service (chatting, e-mail, social-networking, it does as good as everything in one simple and good-looking application), as you can reorder your saved searches or groups & update-intervals for your timeline, replies, dm's and searches."

My processor is 2GHz and I only have 3GB of ram.. my computer still runs flawlessly. However, the app itself is a little laggy, but this isn't even v1. It's v0.30 something or other. And it does pretty much everything for Twitter and Facebook, which I love because although I just started Twitter, I use fb extensively. TweetDeck just brings it all home.
And also, it's a beta. Think about it this way... it can only get better. Good job to the devs of TweetDeck! This is a great app and it's extremely useful. Now if you could get me an Android-compatible TweetDeck app (for my Hero), I would be ever so grateful. Also, please fix the fb thing while I have your attention. Lol. The fb just has the loading bar... but nothing is happening.
The bugs that come with TweetDeck still being in the beta stage is THE absolute only reason I can't give it 5 stars. Other than that, it's great. Keep it up."

It let's you share your activities via Twitter and/or Facebook, and the developers are very responsive to user requests.  Basically all of the features added to the past few versions have been a direct result of user-submitted requests for enhancements.

With accurate GPS route tracking, regular stats, training workouts, great website for post activity analysis, this app is ahead of the competition. Add to those features, superb support from the developer, regular updates and great social interaction, RunKeeper is not only a great app but also a best of breed example of how to develop a user community, listen to those users and take on board all their ideas to build an even better product. 

Having raised lots for the charity, I could have hung up my racing shoes for good, but my love for Runkeeper will keep me running for a long time to come!

I liked it enough that I decided to buy the full version even though the additional features weren't necessary to me at the time. I was not disappointed with the purchase, in fact I've come to find the additional features to be an excellent addition to my workout program.

I really like that my workouts get uploaded to twitter and facebook. This way all of my friends can see how I'm progressing towards my first marathon. It also holds me accountable to complete my workouts.

This is one of the few programs that I've bought that I use on a regular basis and I now consider it a ""Can't live without"" program. 

An extra note, one day I posted to Twitter that the program crashed and that I didn't have a run to upload as a result. Later that day I got a DM from one of the devs at RunKeeper asking for specifics about the problem; he wanted to know what happened so that he could find a way to prevent it from happening in the future. I've made plenty of support calls to vendors for other apps in the past and usually I get the feeling that I'm bothering them by asking for help...these guys go out looking for the problems so that they can fix them before anyone else encounters it. That is a company I can believe in."

And, RK is doing what it can to work around these problems - like adding a manual entry  for the times GPS either isn't working properly or when you train someplace GPS isn't appropriate (e.g., treadmill).

Excellent app."

It takes care of so many of my needs including not only twitter, but also my Facebook account (updates, commenting and chat from within Digsby, not to mention achievements), my Gmail (Archive, Report as Spam right from Digsby) and my chat protocols (AIM, GChat, MSN and Facebook Chat) all at the same time.

To top it off, there's incredible development and support teams, unconventional revenue models (that I love), and the ability to skin and customize the software to your liking. All in all this program is nearly perfect (Mac/Linux support is coming), and I would recommend it to any Windows user that uses any of those services.

- Separate your feed into groups either focusing on the tweets you want to filtering out the ones you don't. 
- Easily reply or retweet new tweets directly from the pop-up notification without really leaving the app you're working in. 
- Thread tweets, thus following the preceding tweets (and essential conversation) of @replies.
- Digsby will help shorten multiple URLs and whole tweets.
- Save your searches as ""Twitter groups"".

All the above PLUS a fully integrated Facebook home feed, LinkedIn feed, Instant Messaging and Email.

Granted there are a few features (group chat, that are lacking but Digsby isn't officially out of beta yet. It is a kick-ass all-in-one application that well and truly beats the competition in features and ease of use.

Just some minor comments/suggestions:
1. It would be great to be able to delete/update/pause/etc many scheduled tweets at once, instead of having to carry out the action to each tweet individually.
2. Once a scheduled tweet has been sent, it would be desired that they not appear in the scheduled queue.
3. Personally, I don't like the tabbed list format, where there is no URL for each ""page"" of scheduled tweets.
4. Sometimes I'd like to see more than 20 scheduled tweets per page. When I change the number of scheduled tweets I see on one page, it adjusts that straight away. But once I move to another ""page"", it goes back to displaying 20 tweets only.

Thanks for the great website :)"

Also love these settings:
- Alert Me when (Digsy alerts you when a contact, say, goes offline etc)
- Various formats of arranging and ordering your buddy list around (perfect for an organised person like me)
- Privacy settings (disable the other person from knowing whether you are typing or otherwise)

The drawbacks are small:
- Can't unblock an MSN contact from here
- Limited skins, at least, I don't know how to get more skin varieties

Digsby rocks.

Tweetie 2 isn't super duper impressive until you realize how blazing fast it is. T2 is FAST! The other feature I really like is the Nearby search feature. While this feature does not truly use Twitter's geo API, it is still a neat feature. When Twitter's geo API is implemented, this feature is going to be mindblowing! Other than being fast and having the Nearby tweeters feature, Tweetie 2 is just a solid app.

I would highly recommend using Tweetie 2 as your primary Twitter client."

You have to have 50 followers to buy retweets over reTweet.it 
You can build followers quickly with a site called http://twittgeek Once you get 50 your can then login to reTweet.it  You can always go to just browse all the people promoting over their site.

So the poem's point was lost, considering the words they gave me to work with after exchanging as much as I could to get a variety.

I also am a little disappointed that CoTweet only exists as a web-based app. I would gladly pay for an iPhone app and it could benefit from a mac-based application as well.

After I left the company the business model shifted and they created this product. I had started using Tweetdeck as a solution for accessing multiple Twitter accounts, and was quite happy with it. On a whim one day I tried the Seesmic Desktop app - and immediately removed Tweetdeck from my computer. Besides just being a far more elegant application, the functionality and ease of use on Seesmic Desktop is far and away superior to Tweetdeck ... It's nice to see that cute raccoon every day again!"

Set how often you want your followers to hear from you and BAM, It just works. Justin and his team of developers have done a fine job realizing there is a need for this and filling that void.

Another think I love about Tweetie, is the ability to search discussions, save searches, and follow trends.  With Echofon, I couldnt do that, so I had to wait until I was on my computer or unitl one of my friends/followers started discussing the trends.

With Tweetie2 you can have mulitiple accounts if you choose to have them.  

There are many more features that I haven't mentioned, but all in all this is a great app!"

While all have their strengths and weeknesses, Peoplebrowsr seems to meet my needs best. (1) It's the only one of the bunch that lets me scroll backwards through my streams to catch up on everything I've missed. Other apps stop short at 1hr, 3hrs, 1day, or only scroll back through messages tweeted while I was online. With Peoplebrowsr, there are no gaps. (2) Several apps claim to manage multiple accounts. Peoplebrowsr delivers. It's easy to see which account is active for posting, I can post an individual tweet from any or all of my accounts, and -- no matter which account I use to log in -- I can select any account to follow/unfollow someone interesting. No more logging out of one account, then logging into another account -- BLISS!"

I do miss the use of groups, that's the killer part of TweetDeck in my opinion.

I still have TweetDeck installed and pull it up to browse my groups.

My messages are of the sort that I feel many need to hear them or see them a few times to sink in to a deeper level.

I also see where if everyone used this tool for all tweeting, it would be possible to have no one talking to each other at all, no one reading vital tweets or advertisements either.  Which results in zero communication.

So I use it for the above mentioned reasons and do chat as much as possible and post live when I can.

I really don't care if people I'm following are following me back. I'm not a spammer. To me it's more about culling from my follows people who are not participating in Twitter. (They joined, made a few tweets, then quit.) I wish there was a way to sort people I'm following by date of their last tweet, rather than whether or not they are following me. Even if someone is following me, I'd rather drop them from my list if they haven't tweeted in months.

I just sometimes wonder if I am doing the right thing when I am forwarding these messages. I know I find it fun. I get some responses and get to meet many friends. Twitter has become simpler for me to follow ever since. I only worry to many connections that I am with may cause sometimes to forget all of those links we are connected too.

I still try out all the new releases with an open mind, but I haven't switched yet. I have a feeling I'll become even more set in my ways after v.2 comes out.

I find the app to be performant, easy to use, and aesthetically pleasing. It allows you to save searches, and even though Tweetie is a 'single column' client, I can take my searches and tear them off into their own window/column.

There are only two areas that I feel could be improved.  As mentioned in other reviews, groups would be useful.  I would also like a view whereby I can see either all the DMs I have received, split out from the DMs I have sent. Now, all DMs are grouped by conversation w/specific users.

The feed picked up a hashtag used by those at the conference and those commenting from afar.

The feed had to remain there for five days, and Tweetcooker performed well. There were a few drops in service during that period, but I suspect they were more down to Twitter than Tweetcooker.

Tweetcooker was noticed by many site users, and I got good feedback from those that commented. I'd certainly use it again.

Improvements I'd suggest would include more choice in font faces, colours and layout.

It uses over 12MB of memory, which is not good because we want to be able to keep several programs open when using Twitter. It also gives cryptic connection errors with no explanation from support.

It looks good, but that's about it. It certainly won't replace Twikini as the best Twitter app for Windows Mobile. It needs to be tweaked significantly before it is of much use to anyone."

1)It has a slick looking interface & is easy to post pics & the kinetic scrolling is as smooth as silk.
2) There is no tweet count on Dm's as there is on @ messages
2) I have to keep reposting Dm's & @ replies as 2 times out of 5 they fail to post the first time
3) There is no way to check your Dm messages to a person as there is on mo tweets
4) the Update success message doesn't automatically go away. you have to manually remove it.
5) sliding your finger to access give you lots of information which is good & access to profiles & a wealth of info.
6) Touching the profile pic give you access to the users profile as well where you have to scroll down to to find the Direct message or @reply ,Wouldn't it be better to have just @reply Dm & chat available for a speed?
7) There is no text sizing available
8) when you dm someone it should say who u are sending a direct message to just in case u have made and error. 
9) sometimes when you cancel & dm or @ reply & go to choose a new person to dm or @ reply to, the last persons @ reply i.e. @noname is still in the field.
10) Conclusion. I feel if i had the chance to have reviewed it on a trial (not the 24hr windows marketplace one as by the time i had managed to contact them as the site kept crashing it was too late to get a refund) Then I wouldn't have purchased it as in my opinion it should still be in the beta testing stage & not passed for release to buy it. As I think The program still has too many omissions & bugs in it.

1. Our app is opt-in.
2. We message users to let them know when their network is changing... that's one feature that many of our users like.
3. We now have cancel buttons and ""shut up"" links all over the site, including right there on the first page of reporting.
4. We encourage all users to reach out if they are at all dissatisfied - regret that Hybernaut did not do so.
5. Pricing for most users is currently $1.99 after free 14 day trial.

We hope our users continue to love the application and give us feedback whenever they have it. Please try us out, and reach out to us if you have any questions, compliments, requests or concerns. Use support [at] graphedge.com for that. Or you can reach out to me personally on Twitter, @WaldronFaulkner

Thanks!

Maybe it's just me, but I couldn't find a way to send new tweets, only to RT. That meant a lot more editing. The character counter appears to be buggy -- tweets that fit under 140 characters in twhirl or my browser were ""too long"" in TweetMiner. And if a tweet doesn't fit -- poof, it disappears, and you have to start over. (If there's a drafts folder, I didn't find it.) The pop up reminders are annoying and they don't seem to really go away when I click ""don't show this again."" The pitches for buying the paid version are a bit too aggressive. 

Initially I was looking for something that would let me schedule my tweets so I could spread them out over time. TweetMiner lets me do this, but it's not as seamless as I'd like.

Thanx for the opportunity to share this.

Gave this a try today. After the issues Andrew experienced last week, I was curious. I liked the reporting feature. Gave me options to review several accounts that I hadn't realized were dormant. 

The one complaint, app sent a tweet from my account saying ""I'm cleaning out my twitter garbage with xxxx"". I had checked to opt out of this option yet it still pinged my account. No biggie but it's annoying and certainly gives me reservations to try it again. The app claims to reduce spam but in this instance, it created it's own spam.

This app would have earned 4 of 5 but the auto-tweet fail brings it down a notch.

I can even navigate with the keyboard. I get an audio cue when I’ve reached milestones in my character count. It is semantic, and there are proper headings. Dennis Lembree is a pioneer, a magician, a dedicated soul who is the heart of the real Internet, the Internet I have come to love so much. And that’s why he deserves our support, because he’s giving it away, for fun and for free, expressing love one Tweet at a time."

its not only twitter, who ever used fring at all you can sync with your Live, Yahoo, G-mail, Skype, Facebook & twitter (latest version includes a lot of other social networks, check website for details)
it uses the phone UI, so its relatively easy to work with, im only going to talk about the twitter part, its kind of hard to navigate through at first but it gets easier after your first post with it, unfortunately for those with limited data subscription, Fring always keep updating the twitter for you, no disable or manual refresh.

in the end, if you use Fring for your mobile for VoIP and messaging, twitter will be a good addition for you, other than that i dont recommend it for first-mobile-timers"

With an OpenID you can even skip creating an account! If you need more fine-tuned control, under “Advanced Settings” you can choose the update frequency, the URL-shortening service, and even filter the articles by keywords. If you have a bit.ly account, you can also integrate it through the API and watch the statistics unfold on the summary page.

This is better than that application I signed up for that automatically un-follows those who don't follow me. I can see who and choose when etc and since the persons I need to unfollow is only two or three its great to do by hand. 
I won't even bother sending a DM or @ reply to those people because if they wanted to follow me they would have. Or if they had a valid reason for un-following then they would have sent a message if they had cared to in the first place.

I will be supporting this in the future with donations or purchases of other twitter apps created by this app developer.  If you really need to get across to an audience of twitter users it is beneficial to make sure that your only getting across to the one's who are actually interested.  I have a list called ""didn't follow me back"" and when I follow people and later discover they didn't follow me back and if it is someone not expressely important for me to follow then I put them on that list and unfollow them.  That way I still have some sort of connection with them and can give them another chance later on down the road by visiting that list if I want to.... or perhaps one day they will discover they are on a ""nuetral"" list (not good or bad) and might decide to follow me after all.

What is Gist?
Gist is an online service that collects, aggregates, and prioritizes information about your contacts.

Gist prioritizes that information based on the information in your email.

Our goal is to shrink the time for you to get to a key moment of insight.

Today, you use a variety of sources to find this information.  Gist helps you to view this information in one place and to make that view available to you in the places where you spend your time:

    * in your email: Gist Desktop integrates with Outlook to give you contextual information about a contact, and the Gist web application connects to your Gmail or other IMAP email;
    * in your applications: Gist helps you improve your ability to see leads in Salesforce;
    * on the go: Gist for the iPhone is available for you wherever you are.


Why do you need to use Gist?
Use Gist to:

    * make sense of it all -- gain an overall view of your contacts
    * prioritize your contact -- use the view to find your most important contacts
    * plan your next steps -- see the pattern of information you interact with these contacts
    * and act on that information -- share information, initiate contact, or react to information


When do you use Gist?
Use Gist in three core scenarios:
1) Morning Coffee -- spend 10-20 minutes in your morning reviewing new information produced by your most important contacts.  Use the Gist dashboard to identify, review, and act on this information.
2) Prepare for a meeting -- review the Gist profile for a person you are meeting in an upcoming meeting.  You can do this on the go with the Gist iPhone application, and even email ahead easily if you're running a few minutes behind for that important meeting.
3) Find something you know you have -- mine your inbox for information that a contact share with you, be it an attachment, a link, or the title of a recent email, and use that link to jump back into your email client to review the original correspondence."

If your tweet contains a link, it's posted as such on twitter, rather than changing your status with every single tweet.  The only down-side is that often the image-associated with the post once it's redirected to facebook is random, or non-existent.  Otherwise, a very good service!"

The functionality is simple, the brand-new v3.0 interface is stellar (much easier to play with the settings than previously), and push notifications for @ mentions and DM's is a fantastic touch for Pro users.

I tried several free versions of Twitter apps for my iPhone before I tried TwitterFon, and after just a few hours of use I was convinced enough to buy the Pro version.

My only teeny tiny quibble with 3.0 is merely cosmetic. They've changed the look of the themes and I feel that the way your unread tweets appear is not as obvious as previously. This will not deter me from using EchoFon however, as this is a small detail on an otherwise excellent app."

thats how it should work. I need an application that shows individual people i follow that all of a sudden drop out , so i can return the favor...
Its only right! 
Im not concerned about why or what, just the fact if they drop out , no sense on following them or supporting non supporters/followers.

can someone work on modifying this app???

some of these who dont follow , i would allow for inspiration only, the rest can be dropped out. im not trying to win their support or gain their following although it would be cool too.

But after I downloaded Twittelator Pro I could do more than what I could do with Tweetie. Twittelator has a bunch of features, it's a complete twitter app! and oh, there are a few things that I can't leave: 
- whenever I think I like someone's tweets, I don't follow him/her directly but I bookmark him/her just to be sure whether I still like his/her tweets on the next few days/weeks. No Twitter app has this feature, only Twittelator!!
- Twittelator allows me to edit the list!! I meant, I can add/remove tweeters into a list. 
- Mute button!! ;-)

The most important one is: I choose twittelator also because Andrew (Twittelator's dev) answers my questions!! (Ehhmmm....about Twittelator of course! I've never asked him personal question LMAO!!)

I also work at a PR agency -- full disclosure, our company just started working with MediaFunnel late December but we had been using the service for several months before any business relationship started. We were genuinely ardent fans long before we ever hoped to have them as a client!

MediaFunnel has really made our ""team tweeting"" much more efficient. Before we discovered this tool, we were writing tweets, pasting into emails, sending off to the account manager to review and post -- it was a lot of hassle and frankly a bit disorganized. Now we can all work from the same dashboard and be much more topical, responsive and relevant.

Its new ""Guest Tweet"" opens up the company's Twitter account to those outside the business, like fans, customers, anyone who has had an experience with the brand and would like to comment. The editorial review function is a safety measure that helps to ease clients' concerns and Guest Tweets have brought a lot of useful, interesting commentary!

With the Alerts function, we can monitor our brands and ""assign tweets"" so the right person is responding and we're able to answer DMs and other queries quickly. Personally, I like the clean user interface, it's clear and intuitive without a lot of extraneous activity jumbling up the screen. I think any business, non-profit, club, band or any organization that's engaged in a group Twitter effort would find MediaFunnel an excellent product."

I have tried pretty much every major twitter app out there: Twitterific, TweetDeck (Adobe AIR is awful), Tweetie, now with Kiwi, I could not imagine going back. 

Kiwi has a ton of beautiful themes that allow you to customize the look and feel of your Twitter experience. While it sports a very simple and easy to use interface, Kiwi is very powerful behind the scenes. Instead of just allowing you to manage Twitter via your account timeline, Kiwi allows you to define you own custom timelines based off of any twitter account (even yours) as well as searches. You can create as many timelines as you want! I currently have 3 timelines setup so that I can quickly find the tweets that I care about: Photography, Real Estate, and Rapidweaver. And they are all based off of multiple search criteria. That is VERY COOL!

The other cool feature is the very useful rules system. You can build your own set of rules to highlight certain special tweets that you want to draw attention to. Or maybe you create a rule to hide all of those annoying spam tweets that we all get.

Kiwi is by far the most beautiful, flexible and powerful Twitter app out there."

The one issue I have is it's still a little buggy. I've found it sometimes has difficulties loading, when I know for a fact Twitter is working just fine.

Nice GUI. Thank you WPF.
Mono account but that should change soon I guess.
Few bugs and crashes.

Cons:
Font too large.
Window too large. That does not fit with the intended target users screen resolution. Nobody wants to have a Seesmic window that covers 75% of the screen and nobody has a second display.
Too much noise on Twitter content. This is not related to the Look product but mainly to the quantity of tweets that anyone can get per minute by just following 5 or 6 accounts. You have to go very deep into the tweet history.
I don't like the way the application is installed. This MS two steps online process when installing APPs is not good. It should be available offline as well.


This is my 5 cents...

Its really awesome to look at, and its easy to use. The minus side of this, is that the UI feels a bit slow when exploring the program or when you are twittering. It also is a bit slow at startup (Make a install program that installs Seesmic Feel).

It's gorgeous on full-screen mode and I haven't run into any glitches yet. This latest client from Seesmic is integrates nicely into the taskbar on Windows 7 so that you can rightclick the Seesmic icon to see some shortcuts like the inbox, trends, searches etc! See what I'm talking about here: http://twitpic.com/z93e1. The application is very helpful about 'explaining' its navigational terminology i.e. hover on ""social"" and it'll explain in a little message box that ""social"" means ""friends and groups you follow"", etc. The part I'm not so happy about: tinyurl.com is the default url shortener. The settings page is very sparse (can't add any custom url shorteners or  so I won't be using it so much for twittering, but rather browsing the twitter-verse or twittering sans links. I'll be using Seesmic Look at my default twitter client for a couple of weeks and hopefully, the changes I'd like (bit.ly and twitpic support) will be included. "

First, along with pushing regular IMs to your iPhone, IM+ can push any combination of your entire Friends timeline, @Replies, DMs, or tweets from those nearby, also.  This is IM+'s strongest feature since even if you choose not to use it as your main Twitter client, it can provide timely notifications of relevant tweets.
Anecdotally, I've found IM+'s implementation of finding ""nearby tweets"" the best even amongst its Twitter only competitors on the iPhone such as Echofon, TweetDeck, TwitBird, etc.  In addition, you can easily create a persistent search of tweets so you can catch up on all of the news on American Idol (or Jersey Shore) every time you open the app.
IM+ is less than the best for managing the most commonly accessed Twitter features such as RTs and following, unfortunately.  Most of the functionality is there, but squeezing it into the GUI of an IM app is less than ideal.  For example, the Reply button is pretty small, and you can't follow people directly from the app.  It does have Safari webpage rendering built in which is useful for viewing links and pictures from tweets.
As an IM app, I'd give IM+ 5 stars, but as a Twitter app, balancing it's great push notifications and easy to access search and nearby functionality versus its kludgy implementation of RT and follow yields just 4."

I don't have the luxury of making an effort to keep up on Twitter during the day.

Being able to grow my followers by targeted keyword phrases is really useful.
Additionally, the spam detection is second to none, having 15,000 followers, its inevitable some spammers will get through, however tweetspinner soon removes them!  Awesome.
Also the ability to schedule my tweets, rotate my profiles (saves people from getting bored), searches my dm for spam and auto removes or archives it! Great!, follow my competitors friends or followers. 
It even gives statisical data about people I follow or who follow me!  For only $20 a month, it has made me about $24,000 in the past 6 months and I can't even say I'm using it properly, my friends are doing much better than me!  Try it out for 3 months.

Maybe I'm incorrect, but that's what it looks like to me. There also isn't any info that I could find on their website to describe how the service works.

Well, combine your mobile phone with a Twitter-like app, and you are able to ""check-in"" at destinations nationwide. For retailers, this is a huge win. If you regularly check-in at say, Starbucks, they might be able to reward you with a free cup of coffee. Or those frequent travelers on the road, check in at an airport, and you just might notice a friend/business colleague who also happens to be 2 gates down.  One downfall- need to have better coverage in smaller towns- will make it easier for newbies to understand the value....

Pros :
+ very handy folder view. Makes it easy to follow tweets from your followers.
+ pictures are shown right in the stream.
+ ""in reply to"" visible in the stream.
+ User profile visible at top of the folder.
+ Picture upload works OK and uploaded to Tdash.org.
+ Readability of text is good. Not too small.
Minus - to be improved :
- Cannot click on hashtags and quickly view the stream of that.
- No possibility to use another picture site like twitpic. Default = Tdash.org
- Timeline goes back about 20 hours ? No possibility to go back further ?
- No way to update / create lists. 
- No search possibility

To improve :
- A ""mute"" possibility = not see folders of specific people who you donot want to unfollow, but just don't want to see their folders. Now the folder list can become very long. Too long.
- Quick ""goto"" folder above folder list would be nice."

I really like that I can also tell FB that so-and-so on this network is the same person with a different name on another network.

After realizing that Twitter don't get their own mobile interface to work, I was very disappointed and started searching for an alternative client because I'm often use my PSP for posting tweets.
Fortunately I found twa.sh after some hours of searching which didn't started disgusting me, like the most others.

Dabr looks almost exactly like the official mobile website, never showed up any errors (at least not if Twitter itself didn't had traffic-problems), loads fast, isn't flooded with senseless ads and works on every system that can load webpages (and of course connect to the internet ;) ).
You can not just use every fuction you can actually use but it also has built-in support for Twitpic which is very useful for people that often upload pictures to their profile.
Last but not least is it easy to use.

Oh! Did I mention that twa.sh works perfectly on both, my old Pentium1 and my handheld consoles like PSP or NintendoDS ? :>

The report generated had real, reasonable statistics to show me who I was getting value from and who I was not.  In all fairness it wasn't all spammers, in some cases it was just people with low interaction rates. I was careful about going thru the results generated and I don't feel (much) guilt about unfollowing.

And it's smart enough not to simply mass unfollow so you don't set off the twitter scam alarms (at least that's what message says after hitting the button, if I find out something else, I'll come back & edit here). 

If you are using twitter for more than a couple of months I highly recommend this very simple, effective tool to decrease the noise."

All I am using it for currently is twitter and what it does it does reasonably well but it is my no means perfect. There are good points, it feels very well laid out and intuitive to use, the image integration is great as well but even for a fairly basic user like me this isn't enough. I would like to see much more customization; currently there is no way to alter the automatic refresh rate and the options that are available to you are very limited.

It's the best.  If I have Tweetdeck closed (self imposed no tweeting), I can reply to a DM without logging into Twitter, 2) Robust follower notifications -- shows key stat and recent tweets, and you can reply to follow.  The only negative I'd say is that the timing is off sometimes.  Actually in both directions.  Sometimes Topify gives me DM notices before Tweetdeck, and sometimes Tweetdeck is before Topify. But overall, a HUGE timesaver app."

I've experienced the process of transfering ownership as well as disabling a site. I've worked with large and small as well as public and private networks. 

Over all Ning is a user friendly and economical solution for a start up network manager. A business owner or association manager can quickly create an almost customized site for free. There are plenty of add-ons and features to enhance the site adding value for members.

The opportunities are in the fees and the member interaction. The fees are a la cart and add up quickly. You will pay a monthly fee for a fully branded site where you control advertising. The biggest gripe I've heard from users is the freedom in which members are able to contact other members across networks. There is an upside and downside. Freedom of networking is always a good thing; however when people take advantage and begin to target other members for spam and phishing scams it reflects negatively on Ning."

Sometimes websites have a tendency to make this a little difficult, but MyLikes makes it very easy for you to maneuver through its site. I think the best part of the site is the simplicity of it all. It has a clean look which makes it even better to navigate through as well.

There is also a vast collection of categories to sift through on the site which are divided neatly so that you can find the things that you are looking for. The coolest part is the fact that you can blog or Tweet about products, services, movies, music, etc that YOU recommend and you can MAKE SOME EXTRA CASH while doing it. It is especially great for someone like me who is in college and wants to make extra money on the web!

That being said, what I don't like about it is when you RT, you can't edit. I like that feature in TweetDeck. I also haven't figured out how to use it to tweet things from the web. TweetDeck did that automatically.

I keep going back and forth between the two apps b/c I just can't decide which is more impt. Frustrating."

Its ability to either auto-tweet or custom tweet your songs is outstanding.  I was using TwitTunes prior to hearing about @TweeterForMac and will never go back to it.  @TweeterForMac allows its users to either automatically update Now Playing song to twitter or by doing it manually.  It also allows each user to do so with custom made tweets along with the ability to append a Last.fm url.  It is one of the best Mac OS x menubar applications out there and features a brand new icon that is off the hook. The other features include Tweet of the Moment which allows you to customize your own tweet right there on the spot. One more feature it has is the ability to use Mac OS x growl feature in letting you know what song is currently playing and features iTunes Controls along with bit.ly.

I've only ranked with a ""4"" because while I find the list of fans to be correct, I am unsure of the ""following"" list. I am relatively certain a few of the persons listed *are* following me.

My only fault on this app is that it is $1.99, now depending on how much of a die-hard fan you are will make the buy worth while or not. For me, the $1.99 was a respectable amount but thats a matter of opinion. If it was a 0.99 cent app than its a must buy for all Jet fans. I give it a 4/5, the only point i deducted was for the price.

The Pro version allows push notifications for mentions and DM's for any user. The free version just allows notifications for users that are using Echofon. Also, when using Darkslide Pro iPhone app for Flickr you can send a link of a favourite picture to Echofon and loads up with a blank tweet with the link to the flickr photograph. I've tried this with other leading twitter iPhone apps and they don't seem to work properly. The desktop version of Echofon also supports lists and the other great feature is that you can sync your read/unread tweets between your iPhone and desktop so you don't have to go trawling through hundreds of tweets to find the start of the ones you haven't read. Brilliant app. "

It's a great tool for skimming updates. Simply mouse over the Twitter icon for a recent timeline and @ reply and direct message alerts, in a small column, unintrusive to time and desktop space. The one annoyance I find is when clicking on ""mentions"" and ""directs,"" new windows open, where alerts are listed from oldest to most recent. You scroll down, then they disappear. It'd be nice if replies and DM's loaded the newest on top and didn't remove the links to ""mentions"" and ""directs"" after scrolling. I'd prefer the links to remain with an alert of 0 so that replies and DM's that you may not have responded to or want to use for future reference were still easy to access.   "

I was very impressed with the process on my end, but I think that the receiving end is a little strange. The person getting the voicemail is sent an @ reply from http://twitter.com/pocketsapp where they are notified that the sender (identified by Twitter handle) has sent them a voicemail and it's waiting to be heard at http://pocketsapp.com/voicemails, which redirects to the Twitter OAuth page for the app. People are generally hesitant to allow applications that aren't well known and trusted ... and when viewing Pockets Twitter page, there is only a long stream of @ replies to people receiving the voicemails, essentially no community. They have a low following which is understandable for being new, however, they don't give people any reason to follow them. Good idea, but lacking in execution and assumed willingness to succeed as a mainstream app by lack of social interaction on the social platform, Twitter, that their app is based around. "

Very useful at linking accounts and sending out tweets and the pause facility is very good for purpose of stopping tweets when the user wants to do so not when someone else. useful to kick start the tweet again if necessary. Also timing of tweets is very good as well. If you want to do scheduled tweets or tweets to be posted on a regular scheduled tweets of advertising or campaign purposes use twaitter or tweet u later.


It is easy to use, although it could be easier if he works the linking facility so u can bunch all accounts together.
he can improve by adding play page button and also shifting old tweets to another sent tweets section to get rid of them for what can be seen - hopefully if a person needs them again then he/she can get them back themselves. that would say twaitter bloke time. As they would sent and not deletable so people can a history of tweets from twaitter which they can delete if they want and restore if they want from that area. save him a job doing"

The system admin has blocked twitter using a word based filter, so any web page that has a URL containing the word 'twitter' doesn't open. But Twaitter acts as a fantastic alternative.

Being a geek, I search and read a lot of tutorials on various subjects like jQuery, CSS, HTML or whatever. To start with I used to favorite those tweets but mining the favorites didn't do the job. Then I started storing the corresponding articles on Instapaper and ReaditLater but still wasn't satisfied.

Now I only need to retweet anything I find of interest and if it links to a web resource, it's automatically backed up to my Delicious account where I benefit from the tag structure to easily sort out anything I've tweeted. Packrati.us also works fine with your own tweets and may check your @ replies as well if you ask it to.

The Rat is very active and does the job quietly for you in the background.

The simple fact that venues now have an additional way to get both passive and direct feedback from their customers in real time is really an extremely unique concept. 

The fact that I know where my friends are and what they recommend is great. Software is software so there are going to be some glitches.

I really like the gaming aspect which I think had a significant impact on early adoption. 

One of the critical elements of any social media tool is it's usage. I think many venues in Boston are missing a great opportunity by not leveraging a Mayorship program. People who are active on foursquare, similar to twitter,  also tend to be active marketers/promoters. 

I also like the fact that they invented the ""check in"" and now almost every geo-location app has incorporated such a simple concept.

Can be a much bigger play IMO (thought bubble ""decentralized, platform idendpendent, web based rules management"", or for the cheesy elevator pitch, ""The Yodlee of Content Aggregation and Distribution"".  

I would recommend a bit faster release pace as others are targetting now, but I understand the need to ""start small, think big, validate, then scale fast"".  This one could have much larger vectors hitting a wide degree of future market needs I see in the next 5-7 years.  Congrats and feel free to contact me to discuss further thoughts on this (contact link is on the vanity site below).  Kudos.

Voilà un outil bien pratique pour mesurer la regularité de publication de certains utilisateurs.

Twitter est devenu aujourd'hui incontournable au point de devenir un standard du microblogging, et un outil marketing très abouti et très utile pour être en prise directe avec sa communauté d'utilisateurs.

Le fonctionnement de TweetStats est très simple.

A partir du nom d'utilisateur de votre choix, le service établit un graphique mettant en évidence le nombre de tweets par jour, le tout sur une échelle de temps modifiable. merci

Its easy to read replies, not to mention its nice that you can see things before you click on them. Everyone's tweets look gorgeous in tweetree. 

you can see pictures, so theres no extra clicking or anything of that sort. You can see what something links to before clicking on it- a must for people who dont want to waste time with unwanted webpages and innacurate discriptions of the page that it links to. The cute name of the website is very fitting to the features, as well as the layout. Its really good for photographers or artists, because you dont have to click on a bunch of links to see there stuff. The down-side is a lack of a side-bar, but everything else makes up for it.

Lots of sites contain tweetmeme buttons, which should allow you in principle to easily share an article from those sites in twitter. In my case, when I hit this button, I see the right window - I have a profile on tweetmeme - when I hit tweet in this window, my tweet gets counted on tweetmeme. The annoying part is, that the tweet would not show up in my twitter timeline.

OK, I figured out that the application was not correctly hooked up with my twitter account - but shouldn't it be the app who figures out that something is wrong. Simply counting my tweet, while it not appears on twitter is very frustrating. Why didn't they implement an error message?"

The statistics are just enough (not too much) for me to understand how a topic is trending. I have also used TagWalk for finding new people to follow on a given subject. That can be a little hit and miss but it's much better than randomly watching a twitter feed on the tag.

The only feature I'd like to see tagwalk do is searching on multiple tags. I don't want hardcore boolean operations, just the ability to narrow a search.

Great features, runs smoothly, love the notifications and integration with the rest of the BB operating system and it looks pretty to boot.

So I decided to revert to Seesmic for Blackberry. . . I like it. Its a cute interface. It doesnt crash any other of my other applications like UberTwiter did so I'm good here. Would love to see the refresh automatic becomes smaller. Refreshing every 5minutes is not good enough for me. Would love to see Automatic Refresh : 1 minute in the near future. I dont care if it drains my battery. .I walk with charged batteries. .."

You can search Twitter and when you type “@” you get an auto populated list of the people you are following so you don’t have to remember their handle.  My only complaint is that I get an email saying I have a DM or reply about 10 minutes before UberTwitter notifies me, so its a little slow.  But overall, really great."

I'm finding it very helpful and it requires much less memory than every other Twitter program I've installed on my computer, especially those based on built on Adobe's Air platform (eg: Tweetdeck, Tweetglide).

This program also does a great job of finding new connections and automatically following them.  It is so time consuming to do this via Twitter on the Web.  One at a time is crazy.  Then, after making a connection, if you find the tweeps to be of common interest, shazam! You've got new friends!  I love this program!  Now, if only we could get one similar for the iPhone and iPad.

This is really helpful when you are away from your desk and traveling around and still want to keep up. There is a black list so you can filter out mentions from certain people if you want to. Also, 'do not disturb' automatically turns the service off during hours you specify (like at night when you should be sleeping).
The service is currently in alpha testing so I am sure there will be some great additions in the near future."

A positively wonderful way to sort them all out.  Hovering your mouse over a photo reveals a block with that member's bio.  Clicking allows you to follow or unfollow other users directly from this site.  Saving all your friends' photos as your Twitter background screen is colorful and fun:  All those smiling brilliant faces you've learned to trust for the latest breaking news with brilliant quotes, wise, warm and witty advice.

It could use some minor tweaking to the front-end and it would get a whole lot better. For instance, their terminology ""Stalking"" vs. ""Stalker"" -- which is which? I had to really think about it and then reload the home page to re-read the definitions to help me figure it out. Also, the 'follow' and 'un-follow' buttons are tiny and very close together which makes it easy to make mistakes. It would be really nice to have a column of check-boxes and maybe ""select all"" to do a bunch of changes at once.

 * Mutual = both ""tweeps"" follow each other :-)

 * Stalking = means I follow them, but they do not follow me.

 * Stalkers = means they follow me, but I haven't followed them yet.

The development team is extremely active on twitter, responding to inquiries, thank you's, and bug reports within 24 hours.

I can't recommend this app enough, its too bad it doesn't get more exposure (even within the WebOS community).  It is young, but they have pushed multiple updates since its release and even did a charity campaign around launch.

I mean, how much of a direct effect is at play? Obviously, Kutcher’s race against CNN and the subsequent mention by Oprah were milestones as far as the San Francisco giant was concerned. The fact remains that many discovered Twitter there, and hopped in just to be in stellar company. These individuals are the ones who will put the Famous Chatter website to splendid use. 

Essentially, through the site it is possible to create a list with these celebrities who tweet and see their updates in a single stream, without noise or distractions of any kind. The way this is achieved is quite simple, as you only have to pick the celebrities one by one from the provided list, add them to a custom list and import it into the relevant categories 

From that point onwards, you will be 
capable of staying abreast of every single development as regards you favorite celebrities that have embraced social media. A straightforward service above all – it showcases one of the facets of Twitter that is most popular, in my opinion this will be the future of twitter to get people on board."

It UI fits nicely in the Mac environment, and more importantly for me, is not a resource hog.  It correctly syncs my teitter stream, and in sent items, even inlcudes my posts from twitter.com; as opposed to other clients that only include posts sent from that app.

The conversation view is pretty nice, and shortened URL preview is key showing the domain it leads to.

What Nambu does need is the ability to view users and add followers from the app itself.  Currently, it opens the user's profile in a browser.  And posting to multiple accounts would also be a nice feature as well.

Over all, a clean, simple, and stale app."

I was a tweetie for mac user, and liked it, but it's now gone from my hard drive. Nambu's ability to track conversations is better implemented than tweetie, and the convenience of having the option to view all your feeds - friends, mentions, searches, DMs, lists - in one column is fantastic. No more switching between columns if you don't want to. (And it's customizable, so, for example, you can choose not to see lists in the ""all"" view.) It's got tons of other features as well (URL previews, photo previews, username auto-complete, etc.), and it's fast as hell. When I used tweetie I would always end up keeping twitter.com open because it updated more quickly - not so with Nambu. And, finally, they're great at responding to user questions @nambucom, which is always nice whether you're dealing with a beta or a final release. If you're not using Nambu, you're seriously missing out."

It's stylish, compact, and easy to navigate. In terms of advantages, I like the picture-in-tweet option (it shows up when someone twitpics or yfrog's an image) and auto-resizing of hyperlinks. One of the handiest features is being able to do an @ message and have it auto-fill in the person's username. It's highly customizable and great for someone who runs multiple twitter accounts: clicking on the username of that account automatically generates it from that account, rather than having to manually switch who it comes from.

It's got a really nice, great style, works in (at least) Windows 1997 to Windows Vista/Windows 7 operating systems which is really great. It takes up a fair bit of memory, but nothing I would really complain about. I do recommend!"

The bad news is it takes up A LOT of a computer's memory and ram. So it can make your computer really, really slow. so if you're like me and love having 50+ windows, plugins, and programs running then I don't recommend getting this. Your entire computer might freeze up then!

It's a get thing otherwise and I really like it. I just can't use it much.

One thing I do not like about this though is that if you have the sound on it makes this rather annoying sound every time you receive a tweet. It may just be me but I can't figure out how to turn the sound off! So this is like a huge fall back for me.

The part about twitter that I do not like with this service is that when this posts an answered question to your twitter it does not use any kind of tinyurl. It keeps these really long, really messy, really annoying urls. So it cuts off half the question and answer just so it has really for a super long url and I don't really like that at all.

So it is a fairly big program and not to be taken lightly.

It's a nice program though I found it sometimes doesn't want to send my tweets. It seems to have this problem a lot which can get kind of annoying.

Something else that can get on your nerves would be that sometimes it takes a while to get your tweets. So you could be getting tweets from an hour ago! And in an hour from now you'll be getting the tweets you should have already gotten. This isn't fun either!

It seemed like when they did the big TwitterFox to Echofon change a lot happened. Now, when you get the little pop-up notifications, if you're not on the firefox/flock browser then this browser will come to the front and disrupt everything you were doing just to give you this one stupid little pop-up. 

This I found to be the most annoying thing in the whole world! When it was TwitterFox it didn't have this problem. This annoying little issue only started when it became Echofon.

Also, if you're one of those who looks at names like I am then Echofon isn't the best name choice either. it was great as TwitterFox. I loved that name. Echofon is just like...What? So I don't like the name at all.

I guess it's a nice app. It's up-to-date, does everything you need, easy to use, works great with both FireFox browser and Flock. So it's nice. There are just some things that I personally don't like about it."

As for the app itself, it's very nice. It takes up a worthy amount of computer memory and ram. An amount that I'm not too happy with. 

It's a really nice app though it doesn't update itself often no matter how you change the settings and all. Please, sometimes you have to click on the ""tabs"" more then once or twice just to get there. 

Also, there isn't a scroll bar so you have to move your mouse around at the bottom/last tweet and hope it moves down to let you see more of the tweets. This can really get on your nerves - it really got on mine.

the design is really nice though and it's easy to tweet. Some characters aren't allowed to be used though! So you may want to keep that in mind!"

Tweetdeck is extremely useful for monitoring direct messages, mentions, twitter feed, new followers, keywords, extra accounts etc. Its great being able to see it all side by side. You can also link it to your Bit.ly and shorten link very quickly while posting a tweet. I would reccomend turning off notifications and sounds on most columns and just leave it on for mentions, direct messages and possibly keywords, There are two main draw backs - the inability to separate business Facebook fan pages from personal Facebook pages and the ability to schedule tweets. The developers are currently working on both of these issues and when they do I'm sure I'd score tweetdeck with 5 stars. "

He then compares your total Weekly TLU's to frequent tweeter @scobleizer (as in how many times you could follow @scobleizer and get as many tweets as you are getting).

It allows me to 'save for later' long Web articles I find while on my computer, simply using a Firefox extension, so I can read them at my leisure while I'm waiting in line or travelling by train, especially in areas where there's no Internet connection available. Also, the text is highly readable. My only complaint is on the cumbersome Safari installation on iPhone, hope they get it better and easier in the ner future."

During September 2009, I was searching the internet with Google about alternatives to quench my addición with Twitter, but I had a problem at that time had a Blackberry Curve 8330.. I also had two free alternatives that already had been used at the time.

   1. TwitterBerry –not a bad application and was obviously created to match perfectly with the Blackberry, erm sorry, been attempted, because the 2 versions I had (the last one before you change the name and before) always had the problem I warning light lit and from the phone to vibrate at random times. She also became tedious to not update the stream and sometimes my Logear differences were easily 5 to 6 hours and not get me wrong, I love to read the tweets of my friends but it became tedious to read things that had happened and that the program maxime encouraged the more ascended to the most recent.

   2. ÜberTwitter – actually I thought my search was over, but something I never liked is that the makers of UT have a private server on which nobody has access and did not like that every time he took out picture, the picture stays on that server until the end of time. The worst thing you could do is make the program a free version Adware Adware and had to pay. I don't have any problems they want to do and make money from their sweat, but I feel like my phone that will spread of cookies and temporary files that are used to record commercials and I've had problems with programs that have advertising applications of ""Partners"" business ...

 I was about to give up, when by chance I found a blog talking about a Twitter client that does not suck (A Twitter Client That Does not Suck).  When I saw it, I began to have puppy's eyes to see that if a client was designed by the company Blackberry Xtreme Labs called Twixtreme. Not only am I glad it was free, I loved that did not have ads or anything like that and everything seems indicate that this will be their winning formula.


Without further ado, let's talk about what we offer:
\ First of all, responding to my complaints from TwitterBerry, Twixtreme, is quite fast in its interface. The speed of recording and extracting tweets of your account is quite fast, even with people who use Blackberry with EDGE signal (* cough, cough ... .*).

  Apart from the rapid connection, you have the option to update your own tweets stream or the program do it automatically.
Solving my photos ÜberTwitter complaint, and that a couple of people will like is that Twixtreme and tune your account Twitpic, which means you control directly your photos.

Creating Tweets is another cool little walk well. Apart from Tweets and see your friends' Twixtreme lets you see the latest trends and also look into Twitter, Mark favorite, ReTweet and see answers and references.  I must admit that if I started using it, noticed that the graph of the blue bird, can be a bit annoying at first, but my saying that if it does not, then something bad happens.
 
Why is the title of the article is well then?
  Answer: Even so with the advantages of Twixtreme note, it seems that people are resisting the possibility ÜberTwitter's reign began to crumble when they decided to put Adware and there are many contenders for the kingship. Some people are complaints to the program and I say it is people coming Multi-Client Networks. I do not like the Multi-Networks, I say that the more you use a self-service (Example: Facebook -> Facebook For Blackberry) better enjoy it. Twixtreme why I say that will keep singing.

The only thing I'm not satisfied with, is that it doesn't support LIST. But still, I will give it 5 stars as everything works so smoothly with my lovely Tween."

Issues such as the inability to click on saved searches or lists, increasingly slower performance the longer you use it and various others make it less appealing to Opera users. 

The company is well aware of the issues, however they have assumed that Opera does not have a large enough market share and therefore it isn't worth their while to fix Brizzly. Instead they suggest to use a different browser.

On the positive side is that the interface has a nice, easy to use layout and the ""mute"" option and using DM a la IM are nice features.

Given the lack of company interest for Opera users and the inability to use certain features, I give it a 2 star rating."

Twitter
1.RT function on your own Tweet that you have faved 
2.Reply to all ( latest improvement : not included your own ID )
3.List you followed and following ( for your own list go to profile > menu > Lists )
4.Better preview on Flickr (you can fav and comment on a pic ) found it recently idk if its there all this time but it is worth mentioning.
5.Trends (on search)
6.Highlight on your own ID

Facebook:
1.Facebook notification (with numbers of new notification)
2.Comment with ""post"" button

Love those improvement and waiting for Snaptu's act for facebook to link on apps that are being set as hidden on web,so those apps wont take too much of the phone timeline.

Rock on!
(^_^)

Even then, it was originally created by a third party Sumize who became amalgamated by Twitter at some point. With the advanced search you can achieve results that are simply unavailable elsewhere, and I can see this getting more compelling as the extra icing on the cake becomes limited to twitter.com and not the 3rd parties. For example, a geo-located search in 3rd party apps such as CoTweet (as great as it is) is not possible. The advanced search of twitter does allow this, so you can search relative to a location - this is essential is geography and proximity is a factor in your social media strategy."

The fact that when I click on an email, it shows that person's other social sites and a stream of their activity is great - I get a relevant snapshot of their activities and recent interests, so I can add relevant info into my communications.

It's reasons like this that I see Threadsy's integrated views are changing the way I think about consolidated cross-platform communication: it encapsulates the sum."

Foremost, the application creates social media profiles and submits them to search engines thus enhancing SEO. Publish your own links as well as a dashboard (control panel) for all links, including those of your contacts. Signing in with Twitter makes various other tools available to Twitter users via OAuth. You never disclose your Twitter password. Non-Twitter users create traditional log-in accounts. I participated in development so my rating is 100% objective. Link Infinity truly is a great app that will evolve even further over time."

HootSuite is awesome. But the ""closed"" URL-Shortener-Strategy with ow.ly (and ht.ly) is a great pity. Detailed review and comparison (in german) of common twitter tools for business use: http://bit.ly/tools_twitter

I'm still testing HootSuite vs. CoTweet vs. TweetDeck... I like the *tab* design for different social networks of Hootsuite very much. I hope that TweetDeck will integrate this feature in the GUI. CoTweet has just a one column design but it allows bit.ly. TweetDeck allows even custom URL shorteners since v0.34.2 - This is the future approach I think."

Users are classified by the number of times they are included in a list with a specific tag. That is, if a user has been tagged in 5 lists that have to di with ""marketing"" and is from Paraguay he will be listed as an expert in marketing in Paraguay. His position in the ranking ""marketing in Paraguay"" has to do with how many times he has been tagged in ""marketing""  in comparison to other users that have also meen ""tagged"" in lists ""marrketing"". The idea is you are how other twitter users see you, not how you see yourself.

I have multiple Twitter accounts, plus LinkedIN and a FB fan page, I need to schedule tweets, and I need an easy way to re-tweet something I notice on one Twitter account to another. I also need an easy way to follow somebody from one Twitter account, and also follow them in another. Hootsuite does all of this. Being a Website, (not a Mac-native app) it does have a learning curve, but I found it to be FAR more intuitive than TweetDeck. It only gets 4 out of 5 stars because the link shortener is not working when I paste a URL, requiring additional steps for a very common usage."

I've never had a single problem with it sending my multiple RSS feeds to Twitter and plus it has great bit.ly integration. I discovered it from a reply they shot my way after tweeting my frustration for TwitterFeed. At first I thought it was a mere advertisement, but then after being so frustrated, I tried it out and now I am a loyal user and recommend it to everyone I know. Terrific service!"

Since then, massive improvements and new feature adds have come faster than I can think of them. Pubsubhubbub, custom URL shortener support, Facebook, improved stats and more. Dlvr.it is also outstanding at keeping users/customers informed via Twitter of issues they're having delivering messages (mostly because of Twitter's recent instability). Overall, this is one of my favorite apps. I recommend Dlvr.it to my blue chip clients, something I'm extremely careful about doing with any social media service.    "

Dlvr.it was easy to set-up (there were fewer options in those days but it still is) and most importantly it just worked. The last thing I want to do is spend my time double checking a feed service so having one as reliable as Dlvr.it takes that concern away. Support has been top notch, with quick responses and fixes where appropriate, and the pace of development means there are new features/improvements on a regular basis. In summary it is the best web service we use."

I believe there are infinite opportunities for businesses that are currently not being utilized to the fullest potential.  On a personal level, I really enjoy the service, even playing with a few friends.  I also enjoy keeping in touch and seeing what family is doing across the country.

I have a bit of trouble with the GPS/location feature, as sometimes I will be in a building and the phone will say I'm thousands of meters away.  Not sure if this is a BlackBerry issue or a Foursquare bug, but sometimes impacts check-ins and acquiring badges/obtaining mayorships.

Overall, a great application for BlackBerry, iPhone, and Android... get it and enjoy!!!"

She puts all your most tweeted topics at the top of the page. You can then sort all your tweets based on those topics and look through your tweet history in an organized manner. 

Other cool features: See replies as conversations, all replies to a single tweet are grouped together, super convenient. And lastly, all videos, images and articles show up on Twylah, you don't have to open a new window to view them, that's a big deal for me!

PROS:
*3 months of data is available for free.
*Easy to compare up to 2 other users, AKA competitors.
*Weekly digest is emailed weekly.

CONS:
*The data is not 100% up to date, but it is accurate on average.
*I wish more than 3 months of data was available but I guess that's what the premium paid service is for.
*I wish that I can print the graphs. Some of the graphs can be saved as a picture file but not downloaded as a data or excel file.
*I wish it shared not only the total gain or loss in a day, but also the absolute number gained AND lossed separately. (FYI, Qwitter.com is another tool, not perfect, but still useful)

I started out with one of their free backgound images (which was also great) before upgrading to a custom design. After submitting my design requests, they had a draft background ready for me in no time at all. The design was great, but I had changed my mind and wanted to use one of my own photos to keep it relevant to where I live. This was no problem at all, and David had my amended backround sent to me within days and it was perfect! Apart from the speedy service and high quality of the work, it's the personal touch that makes all the difference. I sincerely felt as though they had my best interests in mind through the whole process, and for that I am extremely grateful and have no hesitation to recommend David and his team for anyone looking to get a custom TwitrBackground. Thanks Guys!!!"

I've been using them as my full time Twitter client since then. Cliqset is very different than something like TweetDeck or Seesmic. They've integrated with over 80 social networks. This means that not only can you follow users who aren't on Cliqset (like Google Buzz or Twitter), but you can talk with them just as if they were. 

Simply put, Cliqset gives you a single place to follow everything you like about any other social network on the web. Definitely recommended!"

If I were a gardening book publisher, I would jump in on these conversations and recommend my books and any other information I have relating to these gardening questions.  Not only are you providing answers to their questions, but also potentially new customers.  If you have a gardening blog, it will drive traffic there as well.

The most practical one I Found is the creation of lists of the people that sent a #followfriday to a user and the option to send them a default tweet thanking (so you don’t forget). 

Other features are: 
oVery balanced front page with a Ranking of the user with the most mentions including the #FollowFriday hashtag. 
oRanking by Country – is unique because it allows people to view who in their country received the most #FollowFriday . 
oRanking by Language – Same as the Ranking by Country it gives you an idea on how was given the most #FollowFriday by Language
oRanking by Verified – Separates the rest of twitter with those very privileged and validated verified accounts which are very well know users, companies, or celebrities. 
oIt limits users who make more than 50 recommendations which can be used to get a #FollowFriday in return.
oWidgets – as of right now it allows you to create a Widget for your blog or website with any selected user. 
oVery simple FAQ’s section which helps understand the process of the ranking of users.
On the User Panel
oRecommend a user and give them a #FollowFriday directly from the Followfriday.com
oFollow the user directly. 
oShare the information on how many recommendations the user received. 
oCreate a list of the people recommending the user or the user recommended.
oNew followers from #followfriday
oHow many recommendations where received on previous Fridays. 
oAn option to grab the Widget for the user. 
oA graph depicting the #FollowFriday mentions from previous weeks.

Overall I am completely impressed by the first launch of Followfriday.com and I can wait to experience the other features that will be added to the application.

I have noticed they have also a shortener URL service called ""Twlr"" that you can use on-site or via a bookmarklet. This service is also still in development, you can see the list of the new functions to come here: http://twlr.me/ .
Personally I am not a big fan of bookmarklet and my use of this service will be conditioned to its adoption by  my main personal Twitter client Chromed Bird or at least big players like Tweetdeck or Seesmic.
This said using their URL shortener service will still bring you more precise statistics. Overall the service is  pretty mature yet, and if it is Twitter statistics you are after then Twoolr is definitively the service to watch for, bookmarked !"

Sure, Seesmic Desktop needs a stronger computer (sometimes it took about 120MB ram from my system) but this still doesn't change the fact that it is the best cross-platform client out there.

The logos are really funny as some of the achievements, for example I earned a badge because I joined before Oprah but you have also more traditional ones when you reach ""x"" followers mark and badges related to the mood of your tweets ...

As it is the service is great but it would be better if it could be automated. For now you just have to enter your twitter name, there is no OAuth identification so I think you have to manually update your score .
It would be great if Twitter could embrace this idea and give us the ability to showcase our badges on our twitter profile."

This ranged from AskMe.com, GlobeAlive.com, Wondir.com, and now Replyz.com. Over the years the needs of the net has changed. Up to 5 years ago most people were active on forum based websites which made the previous question sites quite active, but  now-a-days the world is all about fast and speed. The natural progression for these kinds of sites required adaption to applications such as Twitter. Well, the developers of Wondir.com were on the ball with this one.

Using the fast paced instant transmissions of content all over the net using Twitter, they have opened up the ability for anyone; consumer researchers, public poll services, teachers, students, anyone to post a question using Twitter or on the Replyz.com site itself. Anyone, may then join in and answer the questions they want. You can filter the thousands of questions that come in hourly by the Topics you like to focus on, whether it is Gaming, Computers, a specific TV show, pretty much anything you want. You can then sit back every day, take a few moments to either post your own questions, or answer questions you see.

Replyz is the bold first of its kind to come along and really take the fast paced net by the horns and bring about useful tool that can really change how we research and find answers, using the knowledge and expertise of the people themselves.

I'd rather be able to look at tweets from only specific lists. One point off because lists are acknowledged and editable, but not viewable. Also, it doesn't upload pictures immediately. if you take a picture and then write the tweet, by the time you hit send the twitpic address it claimed for you will have already been taken by someone else, and it simply refuses to post. The way to do it is write the tweet, take the picture, then send right away, which isn't always going to work. I find myself many times hoping to catch a momentary image, and if works I'll write about it. Not a workable usage model with this basic, basic app."

TweetDeck had lists before twitter supported them, so it handles them beautifully. You can still make lists in TweetDeck outside of Twitter, or both, if that's useful to you. Columns can have arbitrarily filters or searches and can be changed on the fly. This app is highly configurable in general, and works with whatever screen real estate you have. It can easily go into ""single column"" mode to act like a typical twitter client, but it still retains the filters, searches, and other features. Rock solid, too. I run it for days at a time, and it never misses a beat, even through the computer sleeping."

TweetCaster allows you to view lists very easily, but you can't make them the default view. To get to a list you want to see, it can be up to 3 menu items deep. Sometimes it can't load data from a list. It will suddenly stop working and just as suddenly return.
It handles multiple accounts, but that should be considered a standard feature. 
The ""Select View"" menu changes the app's whole context, which is a cool way to handle trends, searches, and other views. I think lists should be moved into the top-level views menu, and not hidden within the accounts view.
Clicking on a link or a person's name in a tweet is not very slick. Click on a tweet in any view and you get a (possibly large) pop-up menu listing the links, usernames, and other actions you can do with it. Click the link in that menu and then it sends you to the android pop-up of ""what program do you want to open it with?"" and then you can see your link. It wouldn't be so bad if the menu item descriptions were a little clearer.
I have no performance issues on a Nexus One. Overall pretty solid. UI concepts are a little divided, but you can figure it out pretty quickly."

It's got huge value to people working in the agency side of things e.g. those who need a lot of data to produce reports and tracking for clients. It's user-friendly with an intuitive design too. I'd certainly recommend giving Tweasier a go!"

I first heard about Tweasier.com about 6 months ago having met the creator Chris Norton. He showed me how it worked and I have to say I love the email digests it sends you at the end of the day without having to be in Twitter or this application. The stats certainly look useful too so I am still playing around with it but it is a very impressive piece of kit."

In addition to simply looking and feeling good to use, there is the great flexibility to use it simply, or delve into the richer aspects of it to your heart's content.

It's a fine balance to add advanced functionality to a site whilst maintaining its ease of use, and I think Tweasier has already firmly rooted itself in that balanced position. I'm also really looking forward to further developments, and getting a broader understanding of how this rich tool can really help in driving my business."

Considering it's free, it really is a powerful app, and I'd reccommend any agency bods to try it out. From what I hear, there are a number of very exciting developments in the pipeline that will improve it even more, so watch this space..."

"7498"	"3023"	"Lloyd Gofton"	"Liberatelloyd"	"5"	"0"	"2010-08-05 08:28:43 UTC"	"So, what’s the difference between Tweasier and the other Twitter management applications? Surely Chris has missed the boat and been beaten to the punch by other Twitter clients? Well, no, Tweasier is much more than a client. Tweasier’s brilliance is in the features it offers, and specifically the analytics suite.

Yes, i know there are other free Twitter analytics packages, but Tweasier is well…easier. It’s an all in one package, and the Tweasier team has obviously put a lot of thought into exactly what the user wants from their Twitter application, including simple but effective search and suggestions features.

Take my advice, when you go to Tweasier, check out the Analytics package, and have a play. I think it’s a real triumph of useful data displayed in a simple and readable format. The dashboard offers 30 different types of stats, including network features that show who of your followers is most influential. Some stats can also be exported, which makes my life so much easier!

Tweasier is currently in Beta and i’m sure it will improve, but it’s already excellent, and although i’m sure the last few weeks before launch have been tough for Chris and his team, he can rest assured that it’s been worth it. I’ve already shown the package to a few clients and they all love it.

Well done guys!"
"7499"	"3023"	"Soto"	"SotoThailand"	"5"	"0"	"2010-08-05 09:15:21 UTC"	"We use Twitter to communicate with our customers as it makes sense as we are an online business that sells bespoke contemporary furniture. We use Tweasier to see who are the most influential users in our network and to stay up to date with what is happening in our Twitter account. I really like the activity feed that presents all of the latest activity from your Twitter account similar to the Facebook newsfeed. However, one of the most important features is probably the email digests as this can help when you are on the road as it means you don’t have to log in and out of twitter it all arrives on your mobile. I think the interface could be better and I know that the guys are upgrading the statistics sections but all in all I think Tweasier is a useful Twitter application if you use Twitter for business and you are looking to save time."

I'm now reguarly checking out Foodspotting before I order off a menu. Goodbye indecision!

Let me preface this with the fact that I'm an Android user. Currently, they don't have an Android app, so what I have to do is take pictures of my food, send the pictures to my e-mail, then upload them to the site. So, that knocks off a star. 


That being said, I still love Foodspotting! I'm a visual person, so being able to type in seafood and having results come up based on my cravings is pretty awesome. And (in theory) it's all food people love, so unlike regular review sites, you don't have to skim through what you shouldn't get at a restaurant.

Artwiculate wants no one should complain. Its marketing consultants want others to consider Artwiculate as God, despite the deep shortcomings.
And Artwiculate itself will “never explain” anything, not even as how some tweeters are privy to the insider information.They did not want anything further on truth to come out.
There is a truth that
a)There exists a “train” , which swings the votes , so that people stay motivated
b)There is a “collusion”

While paper.li only does one update a day, Flipboard do it (displays the feed) realtime and instead of one large page with short abstracts, Flipboard gives you longer abstracts, pictures and TEN pages.
I'm getting a sense that somehow these Rss-zines will change the way we interact with social media. First it's much easier to read (the feeds) an iPad paper than a twitter stream and secondly - I will want to have the best contributors in my zine. This, I think, will make me more selective as to who I follow on twitter and facebook. So this will certainly impact my following on twitter and facebook.

It's another Twitter app that tries to make a statement about, or point to patterns in how people use Twitter, and as such, is fundamentally flawed for me.

Props to James for adding the opt-out prominently displayed on the page, but that's about the only positive thing I have to say about it.

The source and meaning of the data is unclear, with no additional information available, and the explanation is highly subjective; mine says: ""You are doing well on Twitter, you are keeping up with your Tweets but could still do better."" What does that even mean? What signifies ""keeping up"" and what would make it ""better""?

All in all this app seems like little more than a Twitter API ""Hello World"" and I suspect the only reason it's got so much traction is because of the initial auto-tweet setup, so the developer seems to have gotten his traction from abusing the twitter ecosystem, for that a -1."

I believe this was added during the course of the day in response to complaints from people who felt they had not been adequately warned about the auto tweet. I appreciate the developer's quick response to those complaints. Like others who have commented I would like a more detailed explanation of what this measures. It clearly places importance upon interactions with others. A couple of celebrity tweeps who have many followers and quite a lot of influence got very low scores (5% or below). That result can only be by their low number of @ conversations, I think. Interaction is an interesting facet of a Tweeter's activity and worth measuring. I'd like to encourage the developer to keep working on Twitter Apps - I gather he had a tough day on Aug. 16, 2010."

Perhaps the best feature is being able to create tabs that track the tweets of particular followers or a Twitter list. Tabs can also show tweets by keyword or regular expressions if that's how you roll. Each custom tab can have it's own set of alerts. But even with a bunch of tab alerts defined, there's a global Silent Mode that mutes them until you feel like turning them back on.

YoruFukurou has three display modes for tweets which can be helpful when screen real estate is an issue. It also has the super-useful auto completion of Twitter IDs, which is handy when referencing people you don't tweet that often. 


And there are a bunch of other features; if you're a Twitter tinkerer on a Mac, this is the client for you.

A couple of issues though: it doesn't support as many image services as some clients. For example, I use img.ly, but YoruFukurou doesn't support it. Uploading images is a little clunky; unlike most Twitter clients, you have to upload the picture first, then create the tweet that goes with it. The user interface takes some getting used to, especially if you're used to Tweetie or Twitterrific for the Mac, which have minimalist interfaces. And currently, you can only manage one Twitter account using YoruFukurou. I'm using it for my personal account and Tweetie for Mac to manage the others. There's also no Applescript or Automator support if you're looking to automate some of your tweeting.

YoruFukurou ('NightOwl' in English) is a Japanese Twitter client, but there's English documentation at http://sites.google.com/site/yorufukurou/home-en. There are versions for both Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard and 10.6 Snow Leopard.

Back to edit original rating based on everchanging vip and game rules. When asked about a posted RT from 9/25 '1st to RT"" wins - was told that this was an automated post and winner was Random. Week before when was 1st to RT and asked about it - was told that there was a problem with twitter and Tweeter Games decided to go random. Now vip rules keep changing - if won on weekend and paid vip couldnt win the bonus, then needed 50 RTs, now vip status being sold in a nickel or dime increment to get to bonus levels. still waiting for payment as emailed and DMed.

Why? Well, the World Cup was the last straw for me :-) TweetDeck kept crashing, whereas MarketMeSuite didn't fail once. 

MarketMeSuite also lets you manage Twitter and Facebook from one place; helps put Ping.fm and RSS to work for you, offers tweet scheduling, follow/unfollow management and other features that have become must-haves with any Twitter client software or app.

However, MarketMeSuite does one thing none of the other apps can: it lets you ""brand"" the ""via"" line at the very end of every tweet. Usually that line will say ""via TweetDeck"" or ""via the web."" Why not claim that precious online real estate and link juice for yourself?

I downloaded it and found the icon to be a darker shade of blue but the changes didnt stop there.  Once inside I entered my information and was off to find the awesome UI and slide panels used to browse your tweets.  It looks a lot like Tweetie for mac but better.  The only thing I was surprised not to see was the added features when composing a tweet like in Twitter for iPhone (i.e. hashtags, usernames, etc.).

After entering my information the very first thing that caught my eye (or ear) was the bird chirp whenever you have a new tweet, mention, or dm.  They have had a few recent updates that allow you to change the color either the classic black or the new white look.  A few small features that I love is that when someone replies to a tweet you no longer have to reply with ""wait wat did u send me"" because they have a blue bubble icon to click on which shows the tweet they are replying to.  The ability to tweet either landscape or horizontal nearly creates two separate apps in one.  If you turn your iPad sideways you bring up to boxes with the left column featuring the tweets and the right column featuring the tweet you are on at that moment.  Probably the best feature i found is the ability to randomly tweet your #FF's. You can have it tweet either 5-10 random twitter users that you follow.  @Osfoora HD is THE twitter app for the heavy user with the ability to enter your URL shortener info., a read later menu, and even a safari bookmarklet. I know its a little pricey but trust me you want to drop a few extra $$$ on it!"

Applications running on Adobe Air always are bad news in my experience. It also annoys me that it takes up so much room on a screen but that's personal preference. It also bugs me there's no option to open links behind the App so every time a link's clicked it changes spaces & opens safari. Same goes for twitpics. Some kind of integration like Yorofukurou would be good wherby twitpics are opened in App, full size. I'd also like more control over notifications via Growl not by the Application."

I love this App. It does all the expected stuff you'd want from a twitter client except handle multiple accounts. It's handling of pics is amazing, rather than opening a browser it does it all in App so you get a full sized image rather than one restricted by browser size. It also has great Growl integration & can be customised easily. The image uploading bug's been fixed too. It's in seriously active development which's a good thing obviously. "

The best part of this App is that the man that runs it truly cares and listens to those that use his product and their input and will try to accommodate them to the best of his ability and that is the best part of this App a man that truly cares.

FriendTrend allows a Twitter user to identify the top 100 ""trends"" in the tweets of other Twitter users that they are following over various lengths of time (1000 tweets, 12 hours, 6 hours and 1 hour).
 
Trends can be displayed using hashtags or words.  I have found that the trends displayed using hashtags are more accurate than trends displayed using words.

User Interface is easy enough to navigate - tap on one of the listed trending topics and all related tweets will be displayed.
 
Tap on one of the individual tweets listed and three buttons will be displayed - ""Open Link"", ""Reply"" and ""Retweet"".

The ""Retweet"" option opens up a new ""reply"" window and allows the original tweet to be edited prior to sending.

It's also possible to view the unfiltered tweet stream by tapping on 'All Tweets'
 
Overall, not a bad App for the price but I'd see it as being a companion App to your main Twitter App rather than a replacement."

That all changed about a month ago when I purchased both Angry Birds for my iPhone 4 and my iPad.  The basic concept of the game is to destroy the egg stealing pigs within a certain number of tries for that particular level.  There are about 7 different birds available.  At the start you have the normal (or least crazy bird) red bird that just uses their momentum to attack.  After beating some levels you get a few more birds like a small blue bird that when tapped on the screen splits up into 3 birds, a yellow bird that when touched goes zooming across the screen, a black bird (my personal favorite) that turns into a bomb when it touches something, a white bird that drops an egg when touched, a green bird that acts as a boomerang, and maybe the best of all the Giant Red Bird that destroys nearly anything it touches.  Throughout the game you have to knock over wooden boxes and metal objects to destroy the gloating pigs.  You are rewarded points based on how fast you beat a level.  In the newest updated @RovioMobile is adding a Giant Eagle bird that when called upon destroys EVERYTHING he touches.  This game is THE most addicting game I have ever played and also it allows you to tweet your score and compete against your friends scores.  MUST HAVE!!!"

As I am writing The new twitter features will make previewing of pictures less useful but the good thing is that you doesn't have to click on the link to display the picture on twitter.com. I really like the fact to be able to see the media shared on a profile right away. I am using it in conjunction with Power Twitter , which makes that the videos are display twice sometimes but as you can see on this picture this is really not a problem : http://twitpic.com/2n35o
It allows you to create shorten links ""live"", contrary to twitter default's system when  shortening a link clears everything in the status box...
What would have been nice is to have more video and image service uploader options, this is not really an issue for the pictures if you already use Power Twitter, but for the videos Yfrog would not have been my first choice. Twitplus also offers you emoticons display as well as live feed, it is still in development .
So why giving it 5 stars ? Simply because of its Facebook Like box integration, as of now it doesn't seem to be working completely it doesn't publishes on your Facebook wall but there is a huge potential in this idea ! Here is a screenshot of that feature http://twitpic.com/2qn99g

Bien plus qu’un agrégateur de réseaux sociaux ou de services de chat, Yoono propose à l’utilisateur d’interagir directement avec ses contacts en un lieu unique.

L’utilisateur reste ainsi informé en permanence des activités de ses amis et relations et peut dialoguer avec eux par le canal de son choix, en restant à l’intérieur de Yoono. Cet outil est disponible à la fois sous forme d’extension pour firefox et d’application pour votre desktop (Windows, Mac OS et Linux).

Yoono vous permet ainsi de garder sous le coude la quasi totalité de vos services numériques dans une interface unifiée, qui peut aussi se faire discrète (un unique bouton fait apparaître ou disparaître yoono), qu’il s’agisse de réseaux sociaux, messageries instantanées, flux rss, photos flickr, etc.

Vous pourrez également rajouter des onglets pour vos webmails, votre musique, le service Découverte, ou Web Notes qui vous permet de sauvegarder des morceaux de pages web (un compte yoono est cependant requis pour cette dernière fonction).

Nous vous laissons le soin de découvrir tous les petits plus de chacun des outils intégrés à Yoono, en le recommandant à tout ceux qui sont en permanence sur leur navigateur et qui ont besoin de gérer leur vie sociale virtuelle en permanence, ce pour quoi Yoono est un redoutable outil."

Philo gives you and your friends new ways of exploring television. 
Earn points and unlock awards for watching buzz-worthy shows.

Its quite simple. Philo’s goal is to help you:

Tune in to TV shows
Share what you’re watching
Gossip with friends about tv
What I like about Philo, besides the easy to use interface and logical processes, is the ability to  find shows in real-time based on your location and TV services. Even if you don’t want to tune-in, the app can be your TV guide. May as well play along for the chance to win something. TV doesn’t need to be boring.

Tuning in via the schedule also helps prevent users from gaming the system for the sake of unlocking badges and points – like some of the activity seen on Philo’s competitor Miso.

Philo’s Marketing Manager Christopher Sanson does a nice job engaging users & creating a personal connection to an otherwise impersonal application. One recent promotion for the season finale of Futurama involved tuning-in via the app. Doing so gave you a chance to win prizes such as bobblehead dolls and an XBOX. Another early advantage for Philo.

Philo’s badge designs are well done; extra points for making a badge with Boba Fett on it. Points are also earned with each tune in and it appears that one can earn credits – although I’m not sure how that’s done other tuning-in. Safe bet that future versions will involve even more interactivity and promotional tie-ins.

Not sure if the app’s namesake was influenced by the ancient Jewish Philosopher Philo and his fondness of order and knowledge, or if it was simply chosen for Christopher’s fondness of Philo Beddo in Every Which Way But Loose. I’m guessing it’s from Philo Farnsworth, the famous inventor responsible for creating the technology which lets us view images on TV."

Bantam allows me to weave twitter into my daily task list--I can assign tweets to my team and action them in a hugely efficient way (no more 'favouriting for later'). I like that it adds richness to my contact files and helps with idea generation for projects. The facebook-style live feed is amazing--I feel like I'm ""showing"" my team something cool, ergo encouraging them to think for themselves and collaborate vs. simply telling them what to do. The twitter app is just the tip of the iceberg with Bantam's Social CRM approach to biz/project management.

I tried the first version of Seesmic when it was still developed in Adobe Air at that time I thought that TweetDeck was far more robust. But with this new version I think the future looks bright for Seesmic. It is now developed in Silverlight and has now real-time updates, it is  faster than Tweetdeck by far.
More importantly it is now an open platform you can add a lot of other social networks thanks to plug-ins that you can download in their market place. And if you are a developer you can create your own stuff via the SDK provided. At the moment  I am writing, all applications are free but maybe some will be payware in the future as it could become a viable business model. There is still some imperfections as for example the lack of spell-checking abilities and the fact that you have to restart Seesmic to install your plug-ins,  but I really believe this app is the future. You can really monitor all your social networks at once and even your Google reader feed . There is even a klout integration !
I highly recommend Seesmic and I wish it will continue to improve !

Sprout Social includes a retweet, reply, or quote option so that you can respond to your customers directly from the page, and offers awesome manageability tools such as auto-tweet scheduling, an address book, and more.

Though it is still in alpha stage it is really robust and have been widely adopted by the Twitter community. It is pretty easy to sign-up via OAuth using your Twitter or your Facebook account, once you're done you just have to create your newspaper and here you have three options :
• create a paper based on a Twitter account name and its followers
• create a paper based on a Twitter #tag
• create a paper based on a Twitter list 
The newspaper will be updated every 24 hours and you have the choice of either promoting it automatically or manually. If you chose the later, you can receive email alerts when the new edition is ready.
Attention you can create only 10 newspaper, and the only papers that you will be able to delete will be the one based on your twitter list. I highly recommend it because it allows you to keep up with your different interests and at the same time to discover new Twitter accounts via their Top Stories feature .

Once your  limit of 10 newspapers has been reached, you may also have the possibility to join them. But you will have to convince them !"

So it only makes sense that twitter has an email I can use to update to. I am a busy person who can't monitor my Twitter 24/7 let alone navigate the new interface easily. I will however check my email and Twepe shows me new mentions, Tweets and everything that I need to see in my email inbox. It keeps everything in one place and organized which is great. The only concern I have is, how do I know I am under 140 characters? Still this looks like a more efficient way to keep up to date with my Twitter account though.  "

The thing I really like with this kind of service is that you decide what to keep or not , and to be honest I have  never been fan of auto-sharing.  The filter options are really handy and now you can bookmark your favourites, that they contain a link or not . An other cool feature is that it converts your hashtags into Delicious tags, but you can also decide to ignore them.
Highly recommended !

I should mention that Favstar recently added RTs along with favorites - providing a more holistic view of interest in a tweet.

But what's really amazing about Favstar are it's two other dimensions:
1) Favstar is pretty much the keeper of funny on Twitter - their leaderboard and the @favstar100 and @favstar50 accounts keep track of some of the funniest and most interesting tweets on Twitter. And of course they have in iPhone app, Favit, which lets you peruse these tweets.
2) With a paid account, you can be notified when your tweets receive various levels of favorites. This lets you know in real-time when a particular tweet has suddenly become popular rather than you having to the site. This can be done via email or via a tweet - very useful!"

Thanks to this extension you will rarely have to leave Twitter.com   and you will experience first-hand the future of Twitter.  As you may or not already know, Twitter will be adding widgets to its homepage. In an article by Read Write Web,  Marshall Kirkpatrick noticed that from now it was not hard to imagine ""widgets in the Twitter sidebar from other services, like presentation decks from SlideShare"" . (  http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/twitter_adds_first_widgets_to_its_page.php )

Not only does it work effectively, it adds immediate value, especially for clients and Twitter skeptics, demonstrating how much useful content flows through Twitter on a daily basis.

This is a perfect application to justify Twitter not only as fun, but as a very useful application for everyone. It also coaxes you to ""clean up,"" your ""Followed"" list and concentrate on specific categories of people you follow, since an unorganized ""Followed"" list generates an unorganized ""newspaper."" In days gone by, people said, ""garbage in, garbage out."" Works best with upwards of 500 ""Followed"" people in your Twitter feed.

The company is organized through a University in French speaking Switzerland, so you can imagine it runs very well, like a Swiss clock. Sometimes the ""clock"" seems a bit awry, but I guess they feel the world runs on Swiss time, not US time zones, but that's ok for such a valuable resource."

You can customize how many tweets, twitter lists, Facebook updates, and LinkedIn updates aggregate into a lovely email. Mine starts with new twitter followers and shows those who recently unfollowed me. Then I see the latest updates from the lists I follow--and I can click a button to retweet or @ reply -- and it generates a good old-fashioned RT retweet. My Nutshell mail ends with Facebook updates, birthday alerts, and LinkedIn news.

I used to schedule 7 or 8 Nutshell email updates per day, then I changed to try just one, and now I've settled in at 3 per day. Very customizable, easy."

The website is well conceived but I am somehow frustrated,.Twitter  was designed originally to answer this simple question : ""What are you doing now"",  but here you have to create you beer shelf with the selection of the beers you have been drinking in the past. In my opinion that would be better to tell people what you are drinking right NOW .
Don't get me wrong the beer shelf is indeed a good idea if you want to show off your collection .
 Other suggestions would be the implementation of a ""to-drink"" list based on your friends suggestions and

This application works on two different and complementary levels. On the first one, it acts as a simple tweet button with the ability to add a concise comment. Your tweet will be then sent in the public timeline for everyone to read.  But it is the second layer that is important because  the link you've shared can be the starting point of a threaded conversation . 
You just have to choose your recipients and a direct message will be sent to them along with a link to your private thread hosted on Bccth.is website .
At the moment I experience difficulties to browse recipients because it seems that the system is  based on real names instead of Twitter usernames. As Subtextual started as an email application that pretty much makes sense. But still,  I hope they will take the more informal Twitter context into consideration and offer username browsing.

The only thing I'm not in love with yet are the dashboard UIs, which are presently just stacks of tables and charts, not very dashboard-like at all.

   I used Shared Minds for about five minutes earlier today and promptly jettisoned TweetDeck. 


    I really like how fast Shared Minds is. The navigation panel is tidy and easy to handle - it isn't a deficit to lose the multiple columns of TweetDeck when this is how you move between the various tweet streams. The choice of default, column view, or list for displaying tweets is very powerful - much better to have a scrollable list of 150 tweets, one per line, than the too narrow TweetDeck columns. The search function provides graphical access to the query options - it's the best I've seen for that sort of work. So far I'm deeply unimpressed by the preview pane, which is used to view the details of an account, but it's not a common thing for me to use and like everything else in Shared Minds it's very simple to recover the screen space by dismissing it. 

   Having used it for all of twelve hours these are things that either the program could do better, or that I've not caught on to how to handle.

 1. How do I make a new list? It's not in the 'add a user to a list' popup, which is in the right place and very slick to use for pre-existing lists.

2. How do I see another user's lists? And then follow them?

3. Is there help for the filter option? The way it's positioned makes me suspect it's very powerful, but I'm at a loss for what to do with it.


   This program feels not quite finished, and even so it kicks the competition all over the Twitterverse. Give it a try and you'll likely stick to it.

For example, typing #intro @user1 to @user2 @hashable would trigger the system to send an invitation to both user1 and user2 with a note saying that you've made the introduction. It's quick, easy and painless.

Like Four Square, they do have a leaderboard and do track the most active people to try and give users some added fun. For example you can say #justmet @user3 (via @hashable) and it will add that to your history. And yes, if you choose to keep your introductions and meetings private, you can opt to do that.

It's an amazing product already -- and it's just in beta at the moment. I can't wait to see the future enhancements.

The fact that it has other key Twitter functions (reply, retweet, favorite) just adds to its usefulness during chats.

Other times, when follower limits become reached by Twitter's precautionary rules, it makes sense to weed out those who are not following back to make room to followback my best quality new followers.

I have been using Yoono on Firefox for a long time and more recently on Chrome . As I had to re-install it on my Canary Built I thought I could drop a few lines about it. 
With all the noise surrounding the introduction of RockMelt, people must be aware of this really useful application which supports much more services (I used it mainly to monitor my myspace music pages ) and more importantly that is not linked to a specific web browser. If you are more into desktop application then it is fine as Yoono comes also in that flavour. 
It will definitively satisfy most of the needs and on the media side it can upload directly to  Yfrog, MySites and Plixi (formerly TweetPhoto ) .
** Note about the Chrome beta version : 
There is two ways of displaying Yoono : in tab or in sidebar mode. My only complain here is that I would have liked the sidebar to be integrated à la Firefox instead of having a floating window or at least  for it to be  be magnetised to the browser window. Not a big set-back though if you consider the productivity gain on single screen workstations ."

Team Members, sadly is what differentiates Hootsuite from other Twitter/SM managers - it allows you to invite other people to contribute to your time line.  So you're a company with various departments, then they can all contribute via their own identities to a single time line.  Fabulous.  Unfortunately that will not cost you and it is not cheap.

Personally, I loved to recommend Hootsuite to people, I'd set up accounts for clients and friends, then add myself as a contributor or Team Member - I am then able to manage everyone's account through my single sign on account. Great job.

That was then this is now.  I cannot recommend Hootsuite any longer, in fact Tweetdeck and Seesmic are probably better and easier than Hootsuite, without this this additional functionality Hootsuite is dead in the water.

Argyle provides me with a ton of enterprise application features and function at an open source/small business price.  I have been able to use the data that Argyle provides me with and combine it with solid analytical data about our website.  With Argyle social in my back pocket I am able to provide my department head with solid reasons to value the return of our social media efforts.  We have been able to replace several tools that we used to use daily with just this one - Argyle and it has meant a world of difference in how we manage, track and organize our social media efforts.  What I like about Argyle the most is its ability to allow multiple users to access, edit and update data.  As Argyle grows as a tool I look forward to the many new and improved features I will most certainly enjoy as a customer because I am not going anywhere! Argyle fills the void between free minimal featured tools and  enterprise level applications that would be too big (and expensive) for our efforts.

With all the noise surrounding the introduction of RockMelt, people must be aware of this really useful application which supports much more services (I used it mainly to monitor my myspace music pages ) and more importantly that is not linked to a specific web browser. If you are more into desktop application then it is fine as Yoono comes also in that flavour. 
It will definitively satisfy most of the needs and on the media side it can upload directly to Yfrog, MySites and Plixi (formerly TweetPhoto ) . 
** Note about the Chrome beta version : 
There is two ways of displaying Yoono : in tab or in sidebar mode. My only complain here is that I would have liked the sidebar to be integrated à la Firefox instead of having a floating window or at least for it to be be magnetised to the browser window. Not a big set-back though if you consider the productivity gain on single screen workstations ."

Once you log into Cadmus they will send you a twitter mention indicating that your report has been processed. The link sent will show  your Cadmus home page with important updates that have been posted across all your network,  you can then filter these results thanks to its twitter lists support. They also determine what have been the trending topics in your time-line which provide a more personal and focused experience than the one offered by Twitter. 
If you are using Seesmic Desktop 2 , I highly recommend you their Cadmus plug-in available for free in the marketplace.

The effects range from vintage-drenched X-Pro II to brooding, noir Gotham to Apollo, a washed out Milky Way stratiform that looks great layered over night shots and befuddled dog faces.

Equally impressive is the subtly addictive social feature.  Instagram isn't a preemptive social network, and yet I find myself opening the app more and more just to browse and ""like"" photos, check updates, browse through users who like the same photos as me, follow new people-- all the simple social networking habits that made Twitter and Tumblr so successful.

Key extras: 
A simple privacy toggle gives you the option of authorizing followers before they can view your photos.  

You can quickly find friends from your iPhone contacts, Facebook, and Twitter accounts.  

You have the option of syncing with Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Flickr, and even Foursquare, but the real UX genius here is in the individual on/off toggle features for each platform.  Users are given the ability to choose which of their social networks best suits the snapshot in question, and there's also the option to simply let the photo live on Instagram.  Choice is beauty.

The only seemingly missing feature is an archive for your previous Likes to collect.  But in the context of a moment-driven app such as Instagram, this may just translate to paradoxical mobile baggage-- or a nice premium feature in the future."

Goo.gl URL Shortener  offers less social networks support than its Shareaholic counterpart but in my opinion it is more than enough and it will meet most needs.
What I really love with this  is the quick access to your Goo.gl analytics and the QR code creation abilities. 
I don't know yet how to put the later option to good use but they said that 2011 would be the year of the QR code... Of course as Shareaholic you can customise your shortcuts, I am keeping both for now to see how things evolve. Definitively worth a try.

I am not a huge fan of how the DM tab is organized, I really do not want to see all my DMs with everyone I DM in a giant list. I would much prefer to see them in a threaded fashion so I can easily see the DM conversations I am having. Also the growl notification kill me when I drill in to one persons stream! The other major UI grip is how the ads work. Yes I realize I can pay to get rid of them but I wanted to try before I buy! My issue is the way the ads refresh makes my timeline move around which is very distracting when I am interacting with it. Finally there is a performance issue when new tweets are loaded into your timeline where the app tends to freeze briefly.

Other than that I am a big fan and will be upgrading to the paid version shortly. Keep up the great work guys!"

We are working on some timeouts problems from the Facebook API. The 2nd try always work.

The integration with Twitter profile data is very slick and allows us to have a much deeper view into what's working and not working on the site. Instead of being trapped in the world of aggregated Google Analytics data we can actually get a view into who's really on our site, how they got there, and what they want to do.

We also use the landing page tools to test Twitter marketing messages.  You can throw together a quick landing page in minutes and provide people with a better flow into the site form a Tweet.  Much easier way to test messaging ideas then having to waste developer resources."

Inside @reederapp you can share articles via @delicious @zootool @instapaper @twitter @facebook @pinboardIN & @readitlater.  The UI of this app across all platforms is simply outstanding.

iPhone Version:
The one that started it all and now the little brother to the iPad & Mac versions.  When you open up @reederapp you will see 4 icons on the bottom toolbar (starred, unread, & all items) and refresh.  The app also uses the RSS fav icons to distinguish the feeds even smoother.  If you click on one of the feeds you will see a list of all the articles and have the option to swipe it left (star the article) or right (mark as read).  

iPad Version:
Very similar to my iPhone description yet this time they've taken full advantage of the iPads beautiful screen.  The RSS feeds are now in a grid display with slightly bigger fav icons that look amazing.  On the left is the toolbar where everything happens much similar to the iPhone version.

Mac Version:
The @reederapp for mac is now in beta draft 4 but don't let the 'beta' part scare you away.  They have significantly changed the app with each update for better performance.  The mac version does the exact same thing as the iPad and iPhone version but may have just included the best feature for a mac app.  The latest update included mouse gestures which allow you to use your Magic Mouse or Magic Trackpad with @reederapp.  This is simply pure genius!

If you haven't checked out @reederapp then what the heck are you waiting for... GET THIS APP NOW!!!"

Traveling: I travel abroad a lot and although I buy a international roaming data plan for my iPhone, I don't use Twitter for iPhone, I use tweetymail. Why? Because I simply want to post something to twitter without launching the Twitter app which consumes a LOT of data.

Photos: The iPhone doesn't let you publish photos and video unless you launch a Twitter app, select the photo, upload it, and finally confirm the post. Instead of all that nonsense, just choose the photo from your camera library and email it to Tweetymail, voila it's up.

Replies and Auto keyword search: I use Google Alerts heavily for my business and to monitor personal references. Tweetymail monitors the twitterverse for me for the keywords that are important to me. When any of my accounts are @replied or if any of my keywords are mentioned, I receive an email digest with the details. From the digest I can immediately reply and get involved in the conversation without delay.

It  allows you to display all your social networks and instant message services at once with sleek and unobtrusive  little icons. You can  add dynamic content, from your latest tweets or your RSS feed to your last favourite song or the cause you want to promote. Their email apps will really add some personality to your emails . That would be nice though to be able to sync Wisestamp across different computers and devices but I will still give it 5 stars . Highly recommended! "

Social is everywhere, everything is social. We hear it everyday but with Gist chrome extension this vague notion somehow comes closer to the reality. As you  read your emails you get names (real), pictures, social networks and work information alongside , you can immediately  interact  further  by following your contact on other networks right from your mail box and even make Skype calls .Two complaints here: I  wish it could support other email providers  not just  the mighty Gmail, and it may be slow to load at times.

With an inbox that's constantly full, you wouldn't think that I would be interested in a Twitter app that works through email. But, tweetymail has been an absolute blessing! It's extremely easy to use and very intuitive. Since I live out of my inbox, it saves me tons of time by allowing me to reply, retweet, forward, and much more right out of my Gmail and Outlook accounts. It's great for traveling as well, and beats tweeting out of a Twitter app any day. As a person who frequently works with email marketers, I can tell you that you'll be using email for a long time to come. Why not use it for interacting with / through Twitter as well? Everything in one place, focused alerts, rich new follower notifications, and archive-able tweets - can't beat it. "

In my opinion it will be more destined to casual sharers, people who don't have to post across a large variety of networks at once. This said it has pretty cool features such as the ability to select the Facebook friends you want to share with, and it does precisely what it advertises, that is to say making sharing fast and easy.

I think the filtering options in mentions in Heartbeat is very valuable for brands. I also haven't heard of any other tool offering the buzz graph (kinda like Google keyword research) like Sysomos does in MAP. Plus, the team is super helpful and nice. I recommend them."

**Updated**

I have since received my login and have been loving this tool! Also, David Tran ( @dtran320 ) has been fantastic in answering questions and being readily available via Twitter with anything a user may need to be in touch about. So from a user support standpoint, it is great as well.


In overseeing 6+ Twitter accounts, the multiple account functionality is huge. The suggested Tweet times make things extremely efficient, and moreover, these 6 accounts vary in market/industry, so it allows me to really hone in on the different activity/engagement that exists within each one so I can better plan out my tweet schedule for the week.


The “Follow Friday” suggestions are a neat little add on too.


I just started to try out the “Follow Builder” feature, and so far it has been fun to play around with the advanced settings to create a solid list of people I may wish to follow based on key terms, min/max followers, and by time they have tweeted/etc. I am still messing with this though and hope to get it even more efficient for my use.


While I haven’t yet requested or used any reports, I do like the fact that they are there, and that the Crowdbooster team is making it an option to tell them what you are looking for specifically, and see if they can create reports for you with that data exclusively for your needs. 


I hope everyone gets a chance to check out Crowdbooster, and look forward to hearing the thoughts, and andy tips or tricks, of others!

If you have just arrived in a new place and want to know who to follow in your new area or if you need to find local businesses near you than it is one of the place to start with .
That would have been great if the application could take advantage of the geo-location function that you can find in Twitter advanced search, but to be honest not everyone add location to their tweets.
Definitively worth a try !"

I mean I don't like them at all, the two main reasons being that my bookmark bar is always hidden and the second is that it is already populated with other equally important bookmarklets. This said and though I hope there will be soon a Chrome extension, it is the perfect application to read a full conversation on twitter. Believe me it would take you ages to do this, even  with the new Twitter interface. It is perfect for bloggers and curators who want to save a conversation, all you have to do is to click on a twitter status then on the bookmarklet and it will generate a threaded conversation of the  this tweet (if applicable ).   At the moment you can not embed the result but there is a lot of curation tools that can take advantage of it.

I have for some time now made good use of the web client as well as the iPhone app for Hootsuite.  However, when I first loaded up Hootsuite for iPad I was *stunned*.  It is a remarkably beautiful environment, it works in both Portrait and Landscape mode, and automatically imports your streams when you first log in (assuming you've already created some).  

The only thing holding me back from giving this app 5 stars is that, like all current Hootsuite platforms, it's grossly lacking in its ability to help you manage lists and deal with new followers, and it can sometimes be difficult to follow conversations (clicking on a tweet does not show you any replies to that tweet, for instance).  This isn't a failing of the iPad app, so much as a shortcoming of Hootsuite in general.  

Overall, the iPad app has become my favorite Hootsuite environment.  I'd definitely recommend it!

1. It doesn't have a box to type tweets in. Let me say that again. You have to hit Command-N or click on the tiny light grey on dark grey bird in the bottom corner to post anything. Yes, a lot of people use twitter as a mostly read-only experience, but encouraging them to say something back would be considered a good thing by most people.

2. The typography is pitiful. Type is 30% between black and white, with a spindly font choice that submerges itself into background illegibility. Hashtags are deliberately washed out to 70% white, encouraging you to ignore them and not implying clickability in any way. The timestamps are 90% white. Evanescence is clearly the design goal here. Put this app in the background, and ignore it forever.

3. It feels slow. Clicking on the woefully small profile icons yields a pulsing circle for what seems ages, compared to the snappy response of classic twitter web (New Twitter has a similar lag). Clicking on the profile pictures pops up the full-zize version just after you clicked something else assuming it was broken.

4. No way to find people.

5. Retweeting takes three clicks. Click the retweet button, choose whether to amplify or quote, then an 'are you sure?' dialog that even the UI team from Windows 3.1 would have rejected. 

6. DM's. Hides them well. Perhaps a small mercy, when compared to how both Brizzly and Twitter For Android make DM's a huge deal until you've read them in their particular client. It also abbreviates them to fit a layout, until you click.

7. What he said about confusing UI transitions and photos: http://www.kickerstudio.com/blog/2011/01/the-trouble-with-tweetie-2-twitter-mac-client/

The app should provide a pull down or auto-complete for deleting messages from specific users. Although it provides a number of messages found when selecting by keywords, it seems that it would be very easy to accidentally delete messages because now preview of the messages to be deleted is shown."

Two small remarks though: 
- when people RT, it's not visible in Twimbow, although I see it in the normal Twitter app. 
- too bad the option in a new update to add a music item/YouTube clip does not work properly. I mean the added link does not work with other Twitter clients. I for one like this option very much!

Keep up the good work!"

The metrics are easy to measure, understand and use as part of a social media campaign. With all the tools out there, it can sometimes feel like you're swimming against a tidal force of searches, keywords, social media accounts and monitoring a mass of conversation. But Actionly provides a user-friendly way to get started in a matter of minutes. Great customer service and fully recommend using Actionly for your social media monitoring. "

I'm one of the UK team, and actually we spend most of our time using the metrics to build brand/product/consumer insight for our clients in a similar way you might use a focus group, or perhaps a round of semi-structured interviews. I sometimes think that it's helpful to think of the the world of consumer generated media as a huge, free, online focus group. 

The difficulty in managing what this means for your brand lies, therefore, in gathering all of the truly relevant information- or as much as you are able- coding and classifying it in a helpful way around the business need, and then applying classic qualitative techniques to build insights of value from a foundation of unpredictable data that is actually robust. Hmmm... can you tell I'm a researcher?! This is the sort of thing that gets me really excited about the work we do, and the value of listening to natural, spontaneously generated (and not survey driven) commentary.

Yes, we do have a world class dashboard offering, but actually what is much more helpful for our clients is the analysis and the partnership that we can also provide through our customised research and our dashboard support services. So please don't think of us just as a tool- that would be dismissing the huge value of our McKinsey tie-in too. :)"

I do like how new-style Retweets display the retweeter and at the bottom show the original poster. I don't know why other clients don't do this (or at least give you an option). Even now, it still seems weird to see people I don't follow in my timeline and to have to figure out which person I follow retweeted the update.

Would be nice to be able to remove/hide the search column. Seeing the spinning arrow is somewhat distracting.

Would be nice to be able to distinguish users who follow you vs those who don't in your timeline.

Please add proxlet support!"

I've used Salesforce, Promys, Batchbook, Google Contacts and Outlook for customer relationship management in the past in varying degrees. What makes Nimble different and powerful is it allows for seemless integration with social networks, the ability to convert messages (from any source i.e. Twitter, email, Facebook) in to actionable tasks. It allows you to put together your own tagging taxonomy so you can slice and dice your contacts using various segmentation methods. The development team is very responsive when it comes to requests, help and the odd bug. 

At this point they are doing all the right things from my experience with the product. The reason why I rate it as a 4 star is because they are at the private beta stage and as is the case with all new companies/products nothing is perfect.

I use it on the road for runs and at the gym to track how I'm doing and how often I'm squeezing in a workout. Seeing friends tweet out their runs, is definitely a motivator for me to get off my arse. And it's not just for running, you can track walking, elliptical, biking, and they've even added a lot of winter sports, skiing, skating, etc. There have been a couple glitches over time but most have been GPS, which could have been my phone not the app.

It also makes it a breathe to prepare estimates, invoices, to follow up your payments and communicate with your customers who can accept or decline your proposals online. Their pro-plans are very well designed to match your needs, and the team is very supportive of small businesses and startups. "

First, my RSS feed is accessible from any browser, and since I regularly use three separate computers, a hosted reader is a must (I have not found a plug-in reader that syncs between computers). Second, I have found adding feeds to certain readers can be troublesome. Adding a feed to GR is super simple - grab the site URL (not the feed URL, the site URL) and paste it into the Subscribe field in GR. Done. Third, Google Reader has a very good Android app (and I image for iPhone, too) - great usability and it syncs, so if I read a post on my mobile, that post is marked as read whenever I return to the browser version. 

My only gripe is that you need open a feed in order to mark it as read in the browser version. So wish there was a tickbox or something that I could use to do this, since often enough, I'll disregard a post because of it title."

In late August 2010 Twitter closed a longstanding and often used method used to connect to Twitter Services. In order for br.st to continue working we would need to invest more time and money in to it. The parent company behind br.st, Brinkster, does not feel that it would be the best use of resources and has decided to discontinue all of br.st services.

We loved br.st and we know that many of you did as well. We are sorry that it turned out like this, but it is really beyond our control. We apologize for any inconvience this has caused.

All of the services and links related to br.st are no longer in service.

It's the perfect client: easy to use, clean & simple UI, supports most of the features you want/need in a client and, best of all, it's not overwhelming like some of the other apps I've used (ahem, tweetdeck). The only gripe I have with it (which is why I went with 4 and not 5 stars) is the fact that you cannot see who retweeted you. In order to see who's retweeted you in Echofon, you either have to sign up with a service such as @formulists (which will list everyone that has retweeted you) or you have to open each retweet in the browser.

Once this functionality is built right into Echofon, it will be a perfect 5 and I'll no longer need to access Twitter in the browser again. This is in no way a deal breaker though, I use Echofon on my mac and iPhone, and Echofon only. 

Cheers!"

The two things I enjoy most about SCVNGR is the ability for users to orient themselves with a space and validate their location by taking an action such as snapping a tag, photo, etc. in order to unlock a reward. The orientation piece is great for brands wanting to create an experience for users. In addition to that experience are user-generated content, like tips and the ability for users to add to the challenges. Currently, a very small group of people use tools like this to 'connect,' making the time and financial investment as a brand tricky, unless you just want to reach out to a niche of your market and/or spend the time to educate and inspire behavior change.

This app provided exactly what I needed in a metrics tool: a simple interface, integration with Google Analytics, high level data with the ability to dig into nitty gritty data, and it was very cost-conscious. I receive a weekly report via email with a dashboard overview of my metrics. This is really great for my team and I to look into and build off of.

What I don't like about Klout (which is not at the fault of the app) is the way it's being used as a measurement of job candidacy, social media legitimacy, etc. If they know their users are using it for this purpose, they should consider adding a feature to link multiple accounts. For example, I manage about 7 Twitter accounts on any given day- from my own, to my agency's, to our clients'. If someone wants to judge how ""good I am at social media"" I'd rather give them a more comprehensive view.

By aggregating various channels (email, twitter, facebook, forums, etc.) into a single place, my team needs less training and works much more efficiently.

Our favorite feature is the ""real-time"" nature of the app, so that no one steps on anybody else's toes when working on tickets. And as a manager my favorite feature is their label reporting, which lets me see channel volume trends at a glance.

Its flexible business rules and routing are another huge time-saver, which let us filter and sort inbound tickets into manageable queues.

Lastly, Dan and the gang at Assistly are incredibly responsive to our questions and feature requests. They've assembled a great team, and have built a fantastic product."

Why is you click on a link in the main feed does it pop open a new browser window instead of showing the link in the other pane?  It only does that if you first click the tweet, then go the 2nd pane and click on the tab above the tweet.  If you click on links anywhere in the 2nd pane, it also pops open a new browser window. When you click on another twitter users username via the tab, instead of giving you a list of all that person's tweets in the 2nd pane in a SharedMinds view, it opens a twitter page within the pane? Seems like a lot of extra clicking around.  Maybe it's just me given all the other glowing reviews, but I don't find certain things terribly intuitive. "

I like the ability to view avas and backgrounds in original size, checking who has mentioned me, when I tweet and who is not following me back. It was also good fun to check who my first 10 followers were. Most things can be done without the need to connect to the application."

For starters the software is extremely buggy and several of the functions don't work well including  Klout , Reply Campaign, un-following users & saving settings once they've been updated. The documentation is inadequate, however the developers do seem to be very responsive to support requests. For my purposes Hootsuite, Sesmic or Tweetdeck are much better options that offer greater functionality and more importantly stability."

It does seem that you can set NutShell's send frequency higher (to receive updates more often) than you can with Summify, so it's a good one to look at if you're able to set it up right, and you need updates more often.

I schedule all of our updates through Thrive and have never received a dreaded ""Unable to Deliver: Twitter API Returned an Error"" or met an issue that the Small Act team has not had an answer or been able to resolve.  Thrive stores all of the interactions I have with people on Twitter, making it easy to recognize those who are interested in specific types of content, others who are general brand champions, or the few who are just occasional RTers.  This is invaluable in cultivating relationships with people online in a meaningful ""come to our events"" and ""help us spread the word about [X]"" kind of way.  Thrive makes activating your supporter base much simpler and much easier.  

Thrive's reporting system makes visualizing growth in terms of followers, impact, and interactivity (click-throughs, RTs, etc.) both quantifiable and easily explainable to supervisors and key stake-holders.  It's also tremendously gratifying to graphically see your impact in social media (whereas numbers often lack that emotional connection).

Finally, Thrive is frequently updated with new features that improve the overall experience, and that are driven by the customers themselves (that's right, your feedback actually COUNTS to Small Act).  And each time Facebook or Twitter change their features, Thrive is also updated to incorporate the change, and in some cases, even improve upon it (ask them about the Facebook Custom Action Links).  Highly recommend not only the Thrive software, but also working with the awesome folks who support it.  5 stars.   "

This company has proven to be another bait and switch company that takes your money and that is about it. The next step is to file a compliant with the Better Biz Bureau and Attorney General. Companies like this make it bad for others. There are other companies out there with better reviews and have tech support that is responsive. Buyer beware!

LIKES
•It’s a fun game with great opportunities to meet interesting people.
•By quantifying user activity on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, Blogs, (and soon Foursquare) it provides big brands and average users alike with a holistic measurement of their social networking efforts. This is useful for identifying weak spots and noticing which tactics produce results.
•Brands are taking notice. AT&T and Intel bought shares in me. I understand Ford is planning to sell virtual cars. Altimeter recently created the first branded merch. We can assume others will follow suit.

DISLIKES
•It rewards people who produce quality content, which I love, but success in the game requires an enormous amount of time. If you go on vacation, or take a day off of Facebook and Twitter, your stocks lose value. 
•The game mechanics resemble Twitter in that newcomers are at a distinct disadvantage. Those in power will see their power increase exponentially, while those at the bottom of the food chain and latecomers have to work much, much harder to compete. This may have a demotivating effect as the game progresses. My 2 cents."

Nevertheless I think you could add some more context for users, I mean I would need a hint in some metrics, that I'm not so sure I understand what they mean or what are they measuring. Maybe a help tooltip is more than enough, I wouldn't read any longer than that.
Metrics: like I said before some of them are not so clear, at least for me (I know you're thinking it's me... and you're probably right :P). What does ""Follower to Friend ratio"" exactly mean? Same as help tooltips, it would be great to have some kind of value of reference so I can have an idea how weak or strong a ratio is, or how close or far I'm from the green (not all my numbers are green :S)
Users with not much activity: I guess you initially thought this product for high level activity users (many tweets, a lot of followers) and it is great because those kind of users will find much value on TwitSprout. However, it would be a nice improvement to have a plan B thought for those users that don't have that level of activity, yet ;) I don't know what could it be, but probaly something hourly is not that useful at this time. Anyways, I agree with you that first version should be targeted to those high level activity users.
Excel file: I really didn't get it. I just saw some raw data, and I'm not sure if the idea behind the excel is let me play with that data so I can take some other metrics I like or what. I must say it was not exactly what I was expecting to see (i'm not sure what I was expecting either :S), that's why I don't completly get it.
In sum: very very nice first version of your product. I'm really looking forward to the next version of it :)"

Its useful to know that changes in my follower numbers are occurring at these times. Thank you and keep up the great work! ps Great its all accessible on one page!

The contract is for them to provide email services for my company.  After a few emails exchanging our business practices I received the following email from Clay Moseley on Thu 6/2/2011 3:33 PM.  
Hi Brent,
I’m sorry if I didn’t make it clear during our first call and during the demo when I was talking about deliverability, but we can’t send to purchased lists.  The ISPs are so strict these days, that the ISPs will bulk all of your mail if there are too many complaints.  Do you have any organic opt-ins?  
Clay Moseley
cmoseley@blueskyfactory.com
Mobile: (443) 838-8062
There was obvious miscommunication on the terms of their contract.  On 6/7/2011 at 5:00 pm I sent the following email based on the email I received above.
Amy,
After much thought, I’m not sure your policies will make sense for us.  To date we have not had any sore of OPT-IN option on our site, and while I’d be in favor of that going forward I would need your staff to import our current databases otherwise we would be starting from scratch which I definitely don’t want to do.
Regards,
Brent Rogers
I feel that Blue Sky misled me or didn't properly explain their contract terms to me, there was no explanation that I couldn't send to purchased lists and I feel misled into signing contracts.  I even asked Clay Moseley what the contract terms were and he responded only with the length of contract not with specific stipulations.  
Blue Sky refuses to cancel contract based on the above.  They are trying to continue the contract and have begun sending me invoices even though we have not gone thru the setup of their product.  They have had numerous employees call me and state that they have a signed contract and will expect payment.  I feel like I was misled by Blue Sky when I signed contracts.  I think we should cancel contracts and part ways based on all of the interactions and conversations with their employees."

Overall it is a clean interface and it's pretty easy to use. There are some issues though so make sure you thoroughly go through the demos and ask as many questions as you can. Don't assume anything! I didn't go into depth enough on some basic features that I assumed were included and after purchasing I realized that some things weren't as I expected. For example the comment and content analysis isn't realtime. It takes around 20 minutes to pull content into the hub to be analyzed. This includes people's responses to your comments so don't expect to be having realtime conversations with your customers through the hub. The dashboard is a great tool but it doesn't include facebook comments - only your posts or posts other people have made on your wall. Also with the basic reporting tools that come with the hub you can't directly relate which pieces of content are causing spikes in your charts. You would have to go back in and look at each piece of content on that day to see which ones were customers engaging with the most. 

My client manager is very friendly but can be hard to get a hold of sometimes. For the most part I always get same-day assistance which is great! 

By the time you read this review it might be completely out of date because Awareness is updating monthly. Overall I have had a great experience after having a few issues in the beginning. "

The site combines Q&As with social networking, so you can search for people and follow them to see what topics they're interested in. For example you can follow Twitter's Evan Williams, who is currently tracking topics including Twitter, Facebook, startups and bacon.

When somebody answers a question, you can 'vote up' their answer, just like you would on Digg, and you can endorse users in much the same way as you can hit 'Like' on Facebook or say something nice about a colleague on LinkedIn."

I've used it for some time and I've been impressed by the improvements since initial launch - and not least the willingness of PI to listen to user suggestions and implement them. Where PI scores over something like Klout is with the notion of relevant influence ie influence relative to a topic or issue. That for me is a big plus.  

The list creation facility is also very neat. One of mine in particular has proved quite popular in the UK:   http://www.peerindex.net/andismit/group/pr_week_power_players_of_social_media

I just finished the unpleasant task of dealing with the assumptions and hurt feelings associated with having been dropped by someone whom I (had thought) I had a great Twitter relationship with, DIRECTLY as a result of Twit Cleaner's arbitrary decision to consider ALL who offer Twitter ads via Sponsored Tweets as spammers.

I don't give a rat's pitootie if anyone ELSE lacks the ability to craft a tasteful or useful ad, but there's no way that an overall indictment of the ST service is legitimate, and to cast summary judgement in this case is just flat-out irresponsible on the part of Twit Cleaner.

It was only because I was able to respond to my twitter acquaintance individually that he actually took a second look at my stream to see that I neither post ads often enough nor use content that could be construed as spam. Not sayin' my poop don't stink, but don't just call me a spammer because I choose to use tasteful means to occasionally make a couple bucks tweeting. Them's fightin' words.

I hope this reached someone with enough brains to see this inherent flaw in the system and to do something about it (Laura, I'm looking, hopefully, at you). 

Thanks for listening!

Gone is a reliable messaging system (replaced with ghost notifications, slow pick ups of messages and new followers), the whole thing replaced by a flash looking and basically useless new interface with ill-defined statistics (for twitter) like ""impressions"" and what seems to be an unexplained rejiggering of the (also admittedly ill-defined) interaction and influence scoring systems.

The only think it is missing, imho, is a set of Google Reader-like keyboard shortcuts that would allow me to manage sources more effectively. Once that feature is added, I would gladly pay the $79 fee to establish a business site with Scoop.it..."

Twit Cleaner provided a prompt solution to de-clutter my follow-list. Simple lay-out, and easy to use."

I have found the analytics tool valuable to see if my links are being perpetuated or not. Not quite sure of the re-shared links analytics bit, and I'm still only using the free version, so unable to comment on branding bars etc."
