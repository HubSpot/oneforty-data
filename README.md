## Data and Schema

The following describes the schema for the data files. Each file is tab-delimited and is encoded in utf-8. There is an example importer included that uses Ruby 1.9's CSV library to parse each document if you need a guide.

In addition to the data most items have an accompanying icon in the images/items directory. They are named like [item id]_[style].png where style is either "thumb" (100pxx100px) or "original" (no fixed dimensions). Many items have associated screenshots in the images/screenshots directory.
