tweetPad is software used to visualize Twitter feeds in a new, dynamic fashion. The idea is to not only be on the receiving end of these feeds but to be able to manipulate them; to react and to interact with what we are reading. This is done by deconstructing the text: scrambling the letters or words, breaking sentences apart, replacing words,combining multiple entries into one, etc.

tweetPad also visualizes statistics on the source of the incoming messages (web, sms, instant messaging, or 3rd party software) and the number of characters per message.

tweetPad's interaction is playful and intuitive, using simple mouse gestures to perform all actions.

I love Twitter, but I didn't love the fact that so many of the desktop clients for Twitter were large downloads with visually-rich Adobe Air interfaces or big flashy websites. I wanted a quiet little Twitter client.

So I wrote Quitter.

Quitter is a Twitter client that doesn't announce itself to the entire cube farm; it runs in a command window (or ""DOS window""). There's no installer and no entries in the Start Menu; it will run from a thumbdrive. It's a single small EXE file (about 105k) and it stores its settings in a small XML file.

With Quitter, you can...
Read, post, reply and retweet.
Organize the people you follow into groups and read tweets by group.
Filter (or highlight) tweets from specific users or that contain certain #hashtags.
Use URL shorteners like TinyUrl.com for tweeting URLs.
Easily open tweeted links from other users in your default browser (no copy/paste needed)
Send and receive direct messages
Follow or unfollow other users

Quitter runs on Windows 2000/XP/Vista and requires Version 2.0 of the Microsoft .NET Framework or higher (version 2.0 was released in 2006; most Windows machines should have version 2.0 or higher).

Quitter is free (as in beer) and open-source and will always be both."

For example, you can turn

    http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode
    =&q=louth&ie=UTF8&z=12&iwloc=addr&om=1

into : -

    http://is.gd/1

Our goal is to allow shortening URLs to the maximum extent technically possible.

Uses for is.gd
Here are just a few of the many uses for is.gd's URL shortening service: -

    * Shorten web addresses for emails, forum posts, blogs etc. which cannot handle long URLs and might wrap them, making them unclickable
    * Lower the character count when texting web addresses to a mobile phone
    * Hide the real URLs of affiliate links from visitors to your site
    * Obscure your real email address from bots which harvest them to spam (enter an address like mailto:myaddress@myisp.com). Note that this feature does appear to be browser dependant so such links may not work in every browser
    * Circumvent protections on sites which don't allow direct links to a competitor's site (if you are violating a site's terms you do so at your own risk)
    * Clean up bookmarks for social bookmarking sites or sites with low character limits like Twitter

Certain uses of is.gd are forbidden, for example use in unsolicited commercial email (SPAM). Be sure to check our terms of use."

What has changed?

Almost all of the changes are aesthetic, for now.  The video page is more elegant, showcasing your video with a customizable background.  The homepage has been simplified to focus on what you came to do -- share videos.

BakerTweet allows businesses to use Twitter to communicate in real-time about offers, pricing and stock from a device that can withstand kitchen peril and is much simpler to operate than a laptop or a mobile.


How does it work? (the simple version)

In simple terms it's a bakery-proof box that sends messages wirelessly to Twitter. The clever bit is that the baker can update their messages and things they're selling using a simple web interface. Obviously not something that you'd do mid-bake but it's an important feature for future-proofing the device.

No. Over 1200 characters? Bingo. 1,250 to be exact.

It is obviously interesting to see a tweet that is that long, yet I can already hear some complaining that the essence of Twitter is the “micro” aspect at play. If you send a tweet that amounts to more than 1,000 characters such a concept is bound to be taken to the extreme. Micro-sharing becomes macro-sharing.

Foller.me is a Twitter service that can provide you with the most detailed information about a specific Twitter user in the least amount of time! Here’s how it works.

You input a Twitter name into the searchbox and hit enter. Foller.me gets access to the profile of that user via the Twitter API, scans all the public info and the latest 200 tweets! In general, you’d read those 200 messages to get to know what that specific user is all about, right? Well you don’t have to! Foller.me has done that for you already, and provides you only with the most significant parts of those 200 tweets. It builds up three tag clouds: topics, #hashtags and @mentions, all based on the user’s recent activity, AND excluding all stop words! Isn’t that great?

Recent topics are the words used most in a tweep’s timeline.

#hashtags perhaps are more significant to techies and geeks, most of them include hashtags when posting links. Wanna know what kind of links that techie posts? Take a look at the hashtags cloud!

Finally, @mentions are those people whom this tweep mentioned in the past 200 tweeps. Empty? Probably a robot.

With a few more upgrades we’ve reached out for two more sections – Followers Geography and Followers Rate. The former scans through a profile’s followers and points them out on a Google Map, that way you can get a basic idea which countries do they interact with and of course you get to know when’s the best time to bug that person ;)

The Followers Rate section is powered by the TwitterCounter Public API (thank you Boris!). It plots out the growth rate of followers for a specific profile throughout the last 28 days.

In conclusion, let’s say you’ve received 20 new followers today and you cannot decide whether to follow back or not. You do NOT have the time to read 200 tweets on each of them, right? Your boss will fire you ;) nevertheless you can’t just follow everyone, you’ll get unwanted tweets in your friends timeline. Here’s the key: take one look at his Foller.me profile and you’re done!

And now, with the Sign in with Twitter functionality you can follow tweeps directly from Foller.me without having to go back to their twitter.com profile. This method is extremely safe and doesn’t even require your username or passwod (it uses the OAuth Twitter API).

Other examples. Wanna know what’s going on in the world right now? Read the news..? Watch TV..? Nah, take a look at CNN Breaking News or The New York Times profiles on Foller.me and back to work ;) Latest Web 2.0 talk? Right over at Mashable’s Foller.me profile.

There’s a lot more coming to Foller.me so stay tuned with the blog and follow @follerme on Twitter.

Good luck and follow wisely, with Foller.me!"

The applications - #deals, #video, #question and #poll – use hashtags to aggregate tweets into different groups, making them more useful and easier to understand.

Hashtags are used to by Twitter to group and organize Tweets into different topics.  Just add a # before a word in your tweet, and you create a hashtag that’s used to categorize your tweet.

The initial suite of applications include;

http://video.hashtools.org

#video – Love watching videos online?  #video contains all tweets that link to a page containing a video from YouTube, Metacafe, Twitcam, Seesmic, Vimeo, Dailymotion, Revver plus many more.  You can even play the video just by clicking on the thumbnail preview without leaving Hashtools!

http://deal.hashtools.org

#deals - Collects all tweets relating to deals, promotions and coupon codes into one place.  Find all deals posted on Twitter that relate to a certain Retailer, along with an A-Z of all sites linked to.  With the busy Holiday shopping period approaching, it’s a valuable resource for bargain hungry online shoppers hunting for the latest deals.

http://poll.hashtools.org

#poll – Everyone on Twitter has an opinion, and now there is easy way to aggregate the different opinions into hard facts. #poll lets you easily set up polls directly in your tweet which can be answered by the Twitter community simply by replying to your tweet.  No need to go to a separate website – just reply to cast your vote.  Real time results of the poll are then clearly displayed in pie charts.

 http://question.hashtools.org

#question – Find out what questions people are asking on Twitter in real time, increase your influence and gain followers by providing answers. 

All applications also provide a host of features some of which are

    *

      ·         Link and rich media preview

      ·         Deep link search

Any time Twitter is *cough* busy and sending fails, you can queue your tweet and it will be sent later. If you already know you're offline, as iPod Touch users often are, or just don't want to wait to send a tweet, a single touch queues it for later sending and you can keep on typing.

Frequent users of @names and #hashtags will appreciate that @ and # are right on the toolbar. They're backed by searchable lists that automatically learn new words and provide fast access to stored @names and #hashtags in just a few touches.

QuickTwit deletes sent tweets from it's internal storage after a week, so you'll never run out of room or have to manage them.

* Simple, fast, and easy to use
* Optimized for rapid composing and sending
* Searchable storage of @names and #hashtags
* Immediate access to @ and # from the main screen
* Queues tweets for later sending or sends immediately
* Automatically deletes sent tweets after one week
* Ideal for twittering from iPod Touch when wifi is not available
* Sends all queued tweets in the background with one touch"

~ Frank Lloyd Wright

Tweetery is an amazingly easy to use Twitter client. We’ve purposefully left out much of what makes most other iPhone Twitter apps overwhelming and we think you’ll like it because of it's simplicity.

– Elegant, Clean Design: We believe design is important. Tweetery offers great features without being overcrowded by lots of buttons. The simple interface puts the spotlight where it should be- on the tweets.

– Muting Users: Our quick mute function is a lifesaver! You can easily hide someone’s tweets temporarily without un-following them when they become too noisy.

– Quick Action Panel: Very simple to use, the ""Quick action panel"" makes interacting with tweets a joy. By far the easiest way to tweet on the iPhone. Quickly reply, retweet, direct message, favorite, jump to a user profile, mute a user, or email a link to a tweet– all within a tap.

FEATURES:

Clean, elegant interface
Ad free!
Mute users temporarily, no un-follow needed!
View friend tweets and your mentions
Post new tweets, retweet, and replies
Photo support
Edit or delete your tweets
Send, reply to, and delete direct messages
Add, view, and delete favorite tweets
Follow and unfollow people
In-app web browser for viewing links
View friend profiles
Email a link to a tweet
Intelligent caching recognizes updated avatars
Seemless Refreshing
Quick Action Panel
Manual refresh
We look forward to making this the best way to Tweet on the iPhone and we hope that we can convince you to make this your default Twitter app. Follow @TweetableApp on Twitter to join in the discussion about Tweetable."

What do I do?
If you use Good.ly to make a product recommendation on Twitter, Facebook or anywhere else, and people click on and buy what you suggest, we give 55% of any earned referral fees to charity.

How does it work?
Across the web, many retailers use 'affiliate marketing' to help get people onto their sites. Retailers pay a commission for each sale sent to them through a link from other referring sites. To track these sales, the referring site will use a specific 'affiliate link'.
Good.ly is run by Skimlinks.com, a service that helps publishers earn revenues through afﬁliate marketing. When people click your Good.ly shortened links, we run it through Skimlinks, and make it an afﬁliate link where possible. If people buy anything based on your recommendations, a commission is earned. We work with 8,000 international retailers, so the more product and service recommendations you make using Good.ly, the more you can raise for charity."

Be it a 'simple decison' like which of your favourite restaurants will get your custom next, or a 'complex  decision' such as whose turn it is to make the coffee in your office; Twurn uses a True Random Number Generator to decide whose ‘Twurn’ it really is.
--
Everybody who uses Twurn gets their own public profile which keeps users hooked with up-to-date stats on how lucky they are compared to their peers.

In a effort to keep things fun and friendly, if you lose 3 twurns in a row with the same group of people you get a free pass for the next time you lose a twurn within that group.

((An introduction from Biz & Ev))

The Fledgling Initiative embodies two things that are at the core of Twitter's mission: providing access to information and highlighting the power of open communication to bring about positive change. This initiative is just one piece of that approach. Take part in this mission and pre-buy our limited bottles of the wine. You can follow along with our wine-making activities on Twitter and at some points even participate in its creation. For each bottle you buy, $5 will be donated to Room to Read, a transformational non-profit that brings books, libraries and ultimately literacy to people in the poorest areas around the world. The efforts of Room to Read will benefit literacy, and in doing so they'll allow Twitter to grow. Because if you can't read you can't Tweet!
Thanks,
Biz Stone & Evan Williams "

What's that song? SoundHound knows. It's instant music search and discovery for iPhone (and most iPod Touch devices - see below), including:

♪ Lyrics for your searches and iPod songs

♪ (NEW in 3.1) ""Listen on Start"" option to capture songs even faster (iPhone Settings... SoundHound... Listen on Start)

♪ An instant Say Search that takes you straight to a song or artist - all with sharing and buy links to iTunes

♪ SoundHound’s rich artist info: previews, bios, YouTube videos, discography, top songs, and (NEW in 3.1) tour dates

♪ The world’s first total iPod integration, including the world’s only combined iPod and online music search

♪ (NEW in 3.1) Instant launching of a Pandora station based on your new favorite song - an industry first

♪ Breathtaking design with beautiful animations, visual popularity data, intuitive layout, and incredible responsiveness

♪ Charts of the hottest music including the exclusive Underplayed list: a set of songs discovered in SoundHound much more often than they are played on the radio - an amazing way to find new music

SoundHound (formerly Midomi) is powered by SoundHound's own Sound2Sound Search Science.

Influencers choose to write and recommend Sponsored Likes to their audience through their blog, website or Twitter account. Influencers earn money for themselves or a charity of their choice whenever there is a click from a Sponsored Like to the advertiser's website. 

Sponsored Likes are based on the simple principle that the influencer is the expert when it comes to understanding their audience. Influencers can tailor the Sponsored Like to speak to their audience leading to higher click through rates and superior quality leads for the advertiser. To promote transparency, all influencers have a profile page on MyLikes where all their Likes (some of which maybe Sponsored) along with comments are showcased. 

MyLikes has a unique pricing model that incents influencers to be relevant to their audience, gain their trust and increase engagement. We do this by setting the influencer's cost-per-click based on an an MyLikes Influence score that we calculate per Influencer and click through rates. The more users like a particular influencers' content, (sponsored or otherwise), the more they click on it, which in turn increases their cost-per-click. By bringing an analytical and metrics oriented perspective to this space we aim to make word-of-mouth advertising useful to consumers, influencers and advertisers"

Would you like to integrate cell phones, Twitter, and the internet into your classroom routine?

Then this is the app for you!  This web page app leverages Twitter and its mobile phone capabilities to give you instant feedback from student input in very much the same way that a classroom set of 'clickers' would, except that this is FREE!

Why force students to use/buy/learn a whole new electronic device when the very same thing can be accomplished using a piece of technology that our students already carry around and know how to use very well:  their cell phone.

Here is how it works:
1.  Have your students sign up for Twitter and connect their Twitter account to their cell phone.
2.  During class, ask a question and have your students send a text message to Twitter (40404 in the US) with their response along with a unique search term (ex:  theanswer #smithenglish101).
3.  Use EduTweet to search for your search term (ex: #smithenglish101) and find all your students' responses, with analytics!
4.  Use EduTweet repeatedly by slightly varying the search term (ex:  #smithenglishq1 for the first question; #smithenglishq2 for the second question, etc).
5.  Print each search result directly OR save as a PDF.
6.  Ability to vary the type of graph, the number of search results, and what is printed/saved.

EduTweet works well and looks best in Google Chrome  It has been tested (and found working) in IE7, Firefox3.5, and Chrome.v4.  If you are using a different browser and it does not work, please let me know.

I would appreciate any feedback on this service.  What other features would you like to see?  Is there any feature currently available that isn't working as well as it should or could?

For now, this service is free and without ads.  However, because of this, this app is on an inexpensive shared-hosting server which cannot handle much traffic.

If this app starts getting good traffic (fingers crossed), I would gladly consider upgrading to a better server.

In the (fortunate) event that I need to upgrade servers to accommodate traffic, money can be raised to cover the cost either through ads or donations.  If at all possible, I'd like to keep ads off the page, so donations would be greatly appreciated, both to improve EduTweet and as a token of appreciation!

Thank you for using EduTweet!"

Twoddler is a prototype system as a result of a course on combining hardware and software in an innovative way. It is not a commercial product nor is it available for general usage. How serious you take this, is entirely up to you!
I am a toddler and want my mommy and daddy to know how I am doing while in nursery. They are so busy, but are thinking of me all the time. I want to let them know I am also thinking about them. I can't phone them, I can't mail them and I can't write letters, but I CAN twitter! They love to feel my presence and know that I am active. And that's not all: I can also twoddler with my friends; we have our own way of communicating that is way cooler than sending text messages. We are showing off what we are doing with our activity boards. When I play, my friends can see this! The best thing is: it doesn't have to make sense, no stupid boring grown-up logic -- just playing!"

At Pandora, we have a single mission: To play only music you'll love.

To understand just how we do this, and why we think we do it really, really well, you need to know about the Music Genome Project®.

Since we started back in 2000, we have been hard at work on the Music Genome Project. It's the most comprehensive analysis of music ever undertaken. Together our team of fifty musician-analysts has been listening to music, one song at a time, studying and collecting literally hundreds of musical details on every song. It takes 20-30 minutes per song to capture all of the little details that give each recording its magical sound - melody, harmony, instrumentation, rhythm, vocals, lyrics ... and more - close to 400 attributes! We continue this work every day to keep up with the incredible flow of great new music coming from studios, stadiums and garages around the country."

What Domikado actually means is still a mystery, but we like to think of Domikado as a reminder of our childhoods when life was still easy-going and fun.

We worked to keep costs down, but some developers cannot afford a Chirp ticket. Hungry entrepreneurs are valuable and we want to give them an opportunity to attend, too. Here is how it works: A small number of tickets are set aside in a scholarship pool. Every scholarship ticket generously and anonymously purchased will be allocated to sponsor a cash-strapped developer. A few weeks before the event we will have a process for developers to apply for a scholarship. Then we will select deserving developers and offer them a free ticket.

While most clients organize Twitter with word filters, reverse
chronology or hand-built lists, Taghive browses  Twitter by tweeter,
topic, time-frame and, most importantly, interest group.

First, Taghive creates a ""hive"" of tweeps.  Membership in a given hive
can be defined by hashtag use, presence on a list or tweeting from a
selected geographic area.

Then Taghive creates a cloud of all the tags a hive of tweeps is
using. Then, in right column, you can see every tweet from within the
hive that contains a selected tag. In the left column, you see a
ranking of tweeps who are tweeting the most with a selected tag.

You can also see time-lapse views of the hive's evolving tag usage.
You can see tweets from just your own friends within a hive.  And hive
members can even vote to boot members who are spamming a given tag.

Sounds complex. Everything new does. But Taghive is simple as a fork
and knife, and once you've used it for two minutes, you'll feel better
about bellying up to even the craziest conference or news event."

It doesn't use the Twitter API, which allows it to ""fly under the radar"" and appear more natural. Here are the highlights:

    * Automate twitter marketing without getting noticed
    * Build thousands of followers without worrying on API limits
    * Post and schedule thousands of tweets without worrying on API limits
    * Make money in twitter with or without any followers
    * Reply on thousands of users looking for your offers on autopilot
    * The only twitter software that DOES NOT USE THE API
    * Use An Unlimited Number of Accounts
    * NO Monthly Fees
    * FREE Lifetime Updates
    * The most complete and powerful Twitter Software Available

You may compare words or phrases, seperating each by commas. You may compare maximum 5 words at a time.
Results are live, reflects the data collected at the moment you click compare button. 

Also Twitwinner has a widget service, you can customize and put the widget to your site so your visitors see the comparison live.

------------------------------>>Question:
Is Twitwinner different from other ""twitter stats, trends"" mashups?
------------------>>Answer:
Yes. There are number of apps targeting twitter trends, but none of them give the information focusing comparison, in an entertaining manner.
And most of the twitter trend applications aim more technical people, market researchers; giving technical analysis, detailed charts.
So twitwinner targets general twitter users. Also our widget service is important advantage over other trending apps, as anyone can customize and embed twitwinner to her website.

------------------------------->>To sum up, Twitwinner is,

+++ Simple: It is so simple, just enter words, see the results immediately.
+++ Informative: Besides its entertaining nature, it gives idea about what people talk, what is trending.
+++ Live: The results always reflects data of the moment you make the comparison.
+++ Widgets: If you have an interesting comparison, you can customize its widget and put it to your own site.

SocialFlow’s software helps you determine how and when to reach out to you audience, giving special guidance to stay within the welcomed, conversational format that makes Twitter such a great place.

Your followers on Twitter use the service more frequently at certain times of the day than at other times, and will be more interested in what you have to say at certain times. We help you reach them when they’re both online and interested. Our research shows that timing a tweet properly – for example, waiting a few minutes before sending a message – can dramatically improve performance (as measured by click-through rates).

SocialFlow is currently in closed alpha testing and is available by invitation only. We’ll have more information on our web site soon. To obtain more information or schedule a call before then, email hello - -at- - socialflow.com or fill out our Get Started form.

Please note that the SocialFlow service requires a paid subscription and is most valuable for optimizing outbound communications such as marketing and public relations. If you’re looking for a tool to help you with customer service on Twitter, consider using CoTweet. Individual “power users” on Twitter should consider using TweetDeck. Both are excellent products and both can be good complements to using SocialFlow's software."

They are also expressing needs such as ""I'm hungry"", ""My car just broke down"" and ""Does anyone have a dentist to recommend?"" We call this the “Needium” (the “need” medium). Local marketers would benefit from hearing the voice of the consumer and engaging with them to fulfill their needs but these activities can be hard to discover. In addition, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are extremely busy.

Introducing Needium, the social media local lead generation service for SMBs. Needium monitors social media sources and discovers local business opportunities based on consumer needs and life events. It also listens for merchant name mentions in social media. We surface that information in a Web-based dashboard where Needium community managers (yes, humans!) log-in to join conversations on behalf of the merchant (using the merchant's own social media presence). We basically invite consumers to come visit the local advertiser to fulfill their needs.

This is the true evolution of local word-of-mouth marketing and tremendous value will be created by channelling this “local voice of the Internet”. We believe local conversations on the Web are the great local search disruptor. Consumers are realizing that they can get advice, recommendations and suggestions without having to search in search engines or in the Yellow Pages. "

It's the beta of a new series of apps called Crowdsurfer that uses Twitter to surf the crowd at sports events and other major live events. 

Users at large events can hook up with each other and tweet about the action (and opinions in the crowd) from their vantage point. Anyone not lucky enough to be there can follow the action too from those people 'broadcasting' at the event. The app also filters any other tweets specific to that event and sport.

This edition, Crowdsurfer - Superbikes, is being released in time for the World Superbikes event at Britain's famous Silverstone racetrack.

We've had some great feedback so far and next week we'll be updating the app to make it even more user friendly but we'd love to know what you and your users think of the beta.

We've enclosed a standard PR release that has a bit more information and some screen shots too.

It's just another web client but it has a couple of tools that I like to use. The crap finder was the first of these tools to be made. I needed a clean out after stupidly auto-following for a while. This helped weed out the rubbish by way of keyword searching.
The crap remover filters out keywords from tweets and apps from the stream, while leaving them accessible. (they still come through but are 'hidden' - click to view kinda thing)
Twitpic integration is another handy thing. This works pretty fast by using a ""hit and hope"" method of uploading directly to the twitpic API - no pictures are uploaded to the chritter server at all. There's the option to use Twitter's own media uploading service too, this temporarily uploads an image to the chritter server but it's deleted as soon as it's sent to twitter.

The follower check tells you who you're following who isn't following you back, not for use by those with a sensitive disposition!
There's no automatic unfollowing as per twitter's API rules. I do make manual unfollowing as easy as possible though. In fact there's no automation of any kind in this app. You want to refresh your timeline, you need to click refresh.
There's a built-in URL shortener on the itsb.tk domain. No stats are recorded, it's a database of redirects, that's it!

If you like it, please write a quick review. If you don't like it, please write a quick review. It's not for everyone but it works for me...

With Twitter you are limited to sending Tweets to your network, your followers. Twitter also has in place constraints to restrict ""aggressive following"" therefore limiting your ""reach"". With this in mind it can be difficult to reach potential customers who are outside of your current network of followers.

The TweetMyPitch concept is simple. Instead of Tweeting to your followers, something you are already doing on a regular basis, Tweet to the followers of TweetMyPitch. There are two constraints, firstly you must follow @TweetMyPitch and secondly, you can only send one Tweet per day per Twitter account. It's as simple as that... so what is your pitch? What is your 60 seconds in 140 chars?

How about looking the TweetMyPitch application with Social Media in mind... Pick an influential person that you know, one that you follow and vice-versa. Send a Tweet using TweetMyPitch recommending them, give them a testimonial/complement. This Tweet, with your Twitter User ID, is more likely to be Re-Tweeted (RT) and seen by considerably higher number of people. Not only is the influential person more likely to RT your message but they will also be very happy with you too.

Please feel free to send me a tweet via @TweetMyPitch.

Twittelp easily lets you ask for help from your followers and other local twitter users. Or, step into your own superhero spandex and answer the pleas from nearby people needing assistance themselves. You have questions; they have answers. And visaversa, of course.

Twittelp is a free mobile application that gives users a quick way to ask for help on the twittersphere. Each of your followers will be able to see what you need. Moreover, you can define up to 5 followers (we suggest your best friends or people who are very familiar) who will be mentioned inside the help request! 

Simply use the map to discover who needs help around you. Then, go and help the person or just re tweet the help request, increasing its visibility. 

The mobile client side is currently available only on iPhone/iPod Touch, but will be ready for the Android soon. Once you setup your application, connect it with your personal Twitter account and choose your five favourite followers who would most likely come to rescue you. Now you are ready to ask for help and look if someone nearby your location can be helped.

Every organization faces a unique set of business challenges and opportunities. These challenges and opportunities have been magnified by the pervasiveness of Social Media. 

Most organizations recognize the value of listening to these social media conversations, many are, however, struggling with how to gain actionable insight into these conversations.

It's not enough for businesses to just eavesdrop on or participate in the conversations taking place within social media sites.  Organizations must capture and distill these conversations into actionable insights. 

One of the biggest challenges is to do this in real-time before the conversations and the resulting insights are stale.

We built Gravity to help the right information find you.

Today, we live in a world in which we’re constantly bombarded by information: 90 million tweets per day, 35 hours of video uploaded per minute, 1.6 million blog posts per day and an average of 130 friends demanding our attention. With so much information being created on a daily basis, it’s hard to find what you’re looking for and impossible to know what you’ve missed.

Our answer is the Interest Graph: an online representation of your real world interests and a new lens through which to view the internet. Your Interest Graph is your own personal electromagnet. It pulls the best stuff to you based on your interests and leaves all the noise at a safe distance where it can’t distract you. We build your Interest Graph by analyzing social data (like tweets, retweets, status updates, likes and shares) to create a holistic picture of who you are and what you’re interested in. When you click personalize on a site that uses Gravity, your electromagnet gets activated and the right information starts flowing your way. We connect you with content, people and advertising based on the probability that you’ll love it. It’s about helping the right information find you.

With our platform, any website will be able to tap into Gravity's Interest Graph and enable personalized experiences for their users."

This tool provides Full English language support.  The user only needs to supply an English worded text (i.e., a sentence, a paragraph, or even a page of text) of their basic interests and who they are.  Since this engine provides open-ended search, it will iteratively search Twitter for new users that best match the supplied interests.  This Twitter search engine is more accurate than standard search technology, since it combines both static as well as dynamic features during search.  

Trying to locate new friends on Twitter with standard search technology, can be very tedious.  Often the found results, have little in common with the target search terms, or the chosen user names.  Furthermore, messages tend to be old, infrequently relevant, or even completely off target.  The content on Twitter changes constantly, resulting in a frequent re-ranking of search results, addition of newcomers, and of course departures of old acquaintences.  Finally, the task of locating good friend matches is further compounded by the fact, that individuals' Tweet subjects tend to change over time.

MyFriendTweeter addresses these problems, by completely automating the search process.  The user only needs to supply his own biographical search text.  From this point on the tool will continuously scour Twitter for new friends to follow. The user can at his own discretion decide when to further inspect the newly found Twitter friends and add them to his/her following list. Ultimately, this leads to cost savings in personal search time spend on trying to locate new individuals that match one's own interests.

Support exists for the following OS/Platforms: Windows (NT, 2K, XP, Vista, Win7), Windows Mobile 6.x, Apple OSX, Linux, Free BSD, Open BSD, HPUX, IRIX, AIX, and Solaris. Released as shareware.

The other key benefit of the Twitter Fan Box is that visitors to your web site can follow you without ever leaving your web site. When someone clicks the ""Follow"" button, a popup appears for them to login to their Twitter account or authorize Twitter Fan Box (this uses Twitter's ""OAuth"" feature, meaning they enter their password only on Twitter's web site). Once authorized, the popup closes and the Fan Box updates to show their Twitter profile image in the box.

The most common method for gaining followers on Twitter is to follow users and hope they follow you back. Unfortunately, if you are following the wrong users, you might quickly end up with a huge list of followers who are not really interested in what you offer. This means that although your list will be huge, you will be publishing your tweets to an audience that simply does not convert.

As tag usage has increased, so has tagging pain. It takes forever to launch them, they slow down websites, and they're hard to keep track of once they're launched. UberTags built a tag management system that solves each of these issues. Site managers simply paste their UberTag across their site(s) and then manage all other tag deployments right from a browser.

> Launch a tag in minutes instead of waiting for IT.

Inspired by the old Lomo, Holga, Polaroid, Diana & toy	 cameras whose iconic styles we treasure. Instant Nostalgia now free. 

Retro Camera comes with 5 different cameras: 

The Bärbl - An East German classic, naturally faded with a scratched film and medium vignetting, the perfect all-round choice. 

The Little Orange Box - The Soviet Staple with aggressive cross processing and scratched square film. It's crappy plastic lens leaks in light and exhibits strong vignetting. Black and white option for even more emotion. 

Xolaroid 2000 - Its inspiration is obvious! We love the candid snapshots this camera produces - you simply can't fail, every shot is a keeper. Blue / Green cross processing effects and timeless contrast. Black and white option for that classic touch. 

The Pinhole Camera - A DIY gem and more unpredictable than Schrödinger's cat. Full bleed developing and vignetting through the roof, be sure to give this cardboard chimera a go. 

The FudgeCan - The perfect rig for outdoors; developed on square film that wasn't quite stored... or developed right. But therein lies the charm that'll make your pics with this beauty, memorable and instantly nostalgic."""

Solving the Problem
Founded by public affairs professionals in 2000, CustomScoop approaches media monitoring from the perspective of the client. We created CustomScoop out of a selfish desire to have a product that integrated with the way public relations professionals do their jobs. We knew there had to be a better way to get the Social Media and Traditional News we needed when we needed it.
Understanding the limitations of existing products, we built our search technology from scratch, giving us a unique ability to customize our solution for our customers. Since then, we have continued to refine the original concept, and by working with our customers, incorporating their feedback, and using the most cutting-edge technology available, we have evolved our solution into today’s leading application for monitoring both Social Media and Traditional Media in an integrated solution."

I track popular URLs on Twitter. Is your URL buzzing? Need to get in touch? 
Twitturly tracks the URLs flying around the Twitterverse and provides a quick, real-time view of what people are talking about on Twitter.

Each time someone tweets a URL to their followers on Twitter, Twitturly takes note of it and applies it as a vote for that URL. The more votes a URL has in the last 24 hours, the higher it ranks on Twitturly's Top100. It's that simple.

Whether people link directly to the final URL, use TinyURL, Snipurl (snurl), or any other URL shortening service, we always count the ""votes"" correctly because our spiders actually visit every single site before it gets displayed here.

To keep things fresh and the quality high, the Twitturly Top100 only shows the 100 most popular URLs over the last 24 hours. The 24 hours are constantly sliding and because of some extra smart algorithms, you always see what people are currently talking about. And yes, to prevent gaming of our site, those extra smart algorithms catch pretty much all of the spam and robots on twitter too."

This is the point of YackTrack. As a content producer, you can search for comments on your content from various sources or other blogs that talk about your content. Granted, this may sound like it is targeted at the content producer, but it can also help the people commenting on the content themselves. If you have commented on a blog post, you can find other people that are commenting on the post and join the conversation on other sites. Obviously, content producers benefit as they can track various services from just one location. YackTrack currently supports Blogger/Blogspot, Digg, Disqus, FriendFeed, Google Blog Search, Google Reader, Identi.ca, IntenseDebate, Mixx, Reddit, StumbleUpon, Technorati, Twitter, TypePad/MoveableType and WordPress blogs. Obviously, this list should expand as the site continues to grow.

Another important feature of YackTrack is Chatter. Chatter gives you a keyword search for the social media sites. This allows you to see “chatter” on various sites that talk about a specific keyword. So if you are looking for mentions of Comcast, the cable company, you just enter comcast in the Chatter search box and click the “Find Chatter” button. Similar services exist, but most services are focused just on Twitter chatter. YackTrack Chatter currently supports Mixx, Identi.ca, Technorati, Google Blog Search, FriendFeed and Twitter. Again, this list should expand as the site continues to grow.

We have about 1,500 people working in our Chicago headquarters, a growing office in Palo Alto, CA, account executives based in local markets across North America and regional offices in Europe, Latin America, Asia and throughout the world.

Our company philosophy is pretty simple: we treat our customers the way we like to be treated. That boils down to a few key things:

We sell stuff we want to buy. A great price is only half the battle - it's also got to be a great product or service. Between our top-rated business partners and unbeatable prices, you should feel comfortable venturing out and trying something new - just because it's featured on Groupon. We want Groupon to be an addiction you can feel good about.

No BS. We really want you to love Groupon. ""Gotchas"" and buried conditions that sour the experience are a terrible way to accomplish that goal. We want each Groupon purchase to feel too good to be true, from the moment you buy to the day you use it.

Valuable new customers, guaranteed
Since a minimum number of people must buy for the offer to be valid, Groupon guarantees paying customers. These subscribers are not looking for “the perfect deal.” They’re looking for the perfect excuse to try something new. We get them to your business, and you bring them back again and again.

Efficient, measurable marketing
There are no out of pocket costs associated with being featured on Groupon. We make money by taking a piece of each Groupon we sell. In other words, we only win if you win – and you know what you’re getting at every step of the process.
 
Become the talk of the town
Our eager young audience looks to Groupon as a city guide, pointing them to all of the great stuff they may have never tried, or maybe never heard about, right in their backyard. Customers find about about great new businesses, and businesses get more new customers than with any other form of advertising. 

Big exposure, bigger word of mouth
A Groupon feature puts you in front of thousands of subscribers in each Groupon city – with thousands more opting in each day. Our subscribers share your offer with everyone they know via Facebook, Twitter, and other social media. This buzz will continue to attract new customers for months following your feature."

In email marketing that's smart, simple, effective and most importantly, affordable
Cookie-cutter templates are no way to extend your brand
In email campaigns free from ""graffiti"" in the footer
No one should wait more than 2 seconds for a web page to load
You control your sender reputation, and you should have the freedom to email
with your own IP address
Batman could kick Superman's ass any day
Marketing strategies should include emails sent with regularity
Software should be intuitive because manuals as reading material are overrated
In making it easy for people to unsubscribe and the universal appeal of SpongeBob Squarepants
Analytics are not just sexy, they're essential
In the freedom to integrate systems and automate emails and having lunch at Chipotle at least twice per week
Great customer service is not only possible, it's vital

The most important thing is to have each question page become the best possible resource for someone who wants to know about the question.

One way you can think of it is as a cache for the research that people do looking things up on the web and asking other people. Eventually, when you see a link to a question page on Quora, your feeling should be: ""Oh, great! That's going to have all the information I want about that."" It's also a place where new stuff--that no one has written about yet--can get pulled onto the web.

Accumulating Knowledge
People use Quora to document the world around them. Over time, the database of knowledge should grow and grow until almost everything that anyone wants to know is available in the system. When knowledge is put into Quora, it is there forever to be shared with anyone in the future who is interested."

Do any of these statements describe you?

1. You’re a busy business person who would like to know more about a person you’ve heard about or just met at a conference.

2. You’re a busy parent who’s concerned about your kids’ usage of social media.

3. You’re a single person who just met someone new, and you want to know more about him or her?

4. You’re an HR professional or recruiter who needs to screen many candidates each day, but don’t have enough time on your hands?

5. You’re someone who’s curious about how LadyGaga is like Bill Gates or how Paul Allen compares to Bill Gates? If you answered “Yes” to any of these questions, we have a solution for you: Tweet X-Ray for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch

Tweet X-Ray analyzes a person’s tweets to paint a vivid picture of what that person talks about the most. Here are some of the areas covered by Tweet X-Ray:

* Primary and secondary emotions -- for example, Happy, Sad, Angry, Calm

* Tweet subjects -- these are the six top topics discussed in this person’s tweets, for example work, politics, religion, technology, music, sports, cars, and so on

* Insults and foul language – this is an analysis and listing of words that might be considered insults or are generally considered foul language

Once Tweet X-Ray finishes analyzing someone’s tweets, it displays bar graphs to show how much a person talks about various topics."

Perhaps spotting the next iPad or iPhone give-away promos?

A Brazilian based social media tech start-up, came up with a clever solution for the social commerce era, the Cravelist. A global online automated classified ads listings service based on searches through Twitter messages database from all across the globe. 

It captures, in real-time, any Tweet containing specific keywords related to sales, rentals or donation offers. 

Browsing through the fast growing listings, you find thousands of real people's freshly posted ads for electronics, used cars, houses, apartments, pet donations and many other curiosities being offered online. Relying on an intuitive interface, you can get in touch with the seller without any intermediaries and close the deal in seconds. 

The technology behind this is a spin-off from TwitRadar's social media monitoring system, the company's first product offered online since October 2009. 

Norton Amato, the creator of the Cravelist, explains how it works: “using hashtags like #forSale, #forRent or #givingAway you can get your ad listed on the website for free, reaching a bigger audience beyond your own Twitter followers list. On the other hand, in case you are looking for a good deal or a rare item, you can filter the results with a handy search tool located at the top of the screen. We've used the latest HTML technology to make it also available on mobile devices like Smartphones and Tablets. I personally enjoy using it out on the streets to scout for last minute tickets on music concerts or sports presentations.""

The Craveli.st had great acceptance on June 3rd, when it was first released for the Brazilian market public under the name of Tuitao.com.br. It got spontaneously featured on major content portals and specialized blogs, reaching more than 240.000 people online since then.

Norton Amato comments on that: “We were not expecting such great access on the first days. The thing just took off and we are really glad about all the support we got from the community. Those great numbers encouraged us on speeding up the production process for the international platform.""

Craveli.st is a modern alternative for Craiglist users and has already been considered a revolution on the online classifieds services."

This can be difficult at times using Tweets alone. Sometimes you have a lot to say, and sometimes a group of people want to say things to each other. Keeping track of everybody's comments is difficult with most Twitter clients. Twitter is an incredibly rich source of conversation material, but few clients can actually manage conversations well. This is why we made Threadir (pronounced Threader). Our goal is to help you have fun and productive discussions with your Twitter network.
